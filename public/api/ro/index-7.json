These fancy shops just had too much overhead. like we were paying for a “business relationship manager”, who essentially picked up the phone to give me updates. uh…”</em></p>\n\n<p>we at dojo4 hear this over, and over, and over.   and over.</p>\n\n<p>so many times we’ve talked with clients, given them a solid quote, and seen them get wooed by talk of fancy processes, doubling up on developers, or how test-driven scala makes unicorns poop rainbows out of which mobile apps sprout.  a year later they always come back.  despite a bid of 70-100k they have always spent 300k. this is a magic number in software and yes, it <em>always</em> at least 300k.  in return these clients have pile of software poop, not great products.</p>\n\n<p>it’s sad that this is normal in our industry: people are either drawn to the lowball bids because they don’t care about quality, or they are drawn to the the highball bids that decorate solid software with massive overhead on invoices because ‘it has to be better if i pay more, right?’  the middle path bids–the ones that can produce quality software for reasonable amounts of money–are simply ignored. this is a common consumer behavior in many markets and, although unfortunate in those domains, it’s not fatal. in software this kind of cost/benefit analysis is deadly to the consumer because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>software either works, or it doesn’t.  going cheap makes you risk buying a pile of nothing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>process doesn’t make better software.  going expensive funds many things, but making better software isn’t one of them.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>in case #1 the consumer pays money and has nothing.  in the second case the consumer pays way too much for what they needed and spends too long getting there.</p>\n\n<p>in engineering, constraints are <em>always</em> a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>constraints on money are no different, they are a good thing too. they let people focus on what matters and cut what doesn’t.  too much money wastes time: it let’s people sit around in meetings debating whether or not their pet feature should be in or out.  too much money let’s engineers build auxiliary code that adds nothing to the business value and detracts from the codebase’s agility.  the way to know the right price is simply to aim for a price that is:</p>\n\n<p>“the least amount possible, but no less.”</p>\n\n<p>if you have a good idea, enough great engineers, and just enough money you will hit your target sooner than people that have more of all three.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>p.s. if anyone would like direct evidence of this please contact me. i’m happy to connect you with entrepreneurs that can attest <em>personally</em> to this syndrome–and how dojo4 has bailed them out.  as you can imagine, no one is proud of having gone through this experience and so i’ve left the victims un-named ;-)</p>\n\n<p>p.s.s. i got some great comments about this post from facebook:</p>\n\n<p>“very insightful. i concur 100%.  one other thing to note…even if you do all these things and have built the software properly, things still have a high probability to not work out sadly. market fit, timing, macro trends, micro trends can get in the way. if you have bad software and your business is built around software you have 0 chance.” - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcbigring\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/kcbigring</a></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>(This this is a condensed version of <a href=\"http://www.stuff-things.net/2014/11/14/yes-virginia-you-can-use-sni/\">Yes, Virginia, You Can Use SNI</a> which originally appeared on Spike’s <a href=\"http://www.stuff-things.net/\">Stuff… And Things… blog</a>)</p>\n\n<p>When you connect to a web server securely using HTTPS the security is negotiated using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">TLS</a>. Two things happen, the identity of the server is verified and the connection is encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>The verification is important, it doesn’t matter if the connection is encrypted if you’ve somehow been redirect to an evildoer’s server. However, that verification can be problematic if a web server is serving more than one hostname.</p>\n\n<p>You can read the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake\">gory details</a>, but the simplified version of the process is the server sends a signed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate\">Public key certificate</a> that has to match the hostname in the URL. If a client browses to dojo4.com then the cert must be for dojo4.com, if it’s not the browser throws up a big scary warning.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, it’s possible to have multiple hostname on a certificate, in fact it’s common to have, say both “dojo4.com” and “<a href=\"http://www.dojo.com”\" target=\"_blank\">www.dojo.com”</a>, for completeness. However, it’s a tremendous pain in the ass to add and remove hostnames from a cert. You have to have the issuer generate a new one and revoke the old. And, if you are working with a Content Delivery Network, they are pretty unlikely to add your hostnames to their certificate.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, TLS supported on one certificate per web server (or more correctly, per IP address attached to the web server) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication\">Server Name Indication (SNI)</a> was added to TLS to solve this problem. At the start of the TLS negotiation, the client tells the server the name of the host it’s trying to connect to and the server can then select and send a correct certificate file. Problem solved!</p>\n\n<p>Except… Not all browsers support SNI. Everyone <em>knows</em> this, and as a result, tend to skip SNI and go straight to per site dedicated IPs or even multiple servers. This is an expensive option, especially when working with CDNs like CloudFront. When this came up for me, I decided to see what “not all browsers” really meant.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, SNI is widely supported, with the big issues being IE8 and below and any version of IE running on Windows XP (because the underlying OS library doesn’t support SNI). There are also some old version of Android out there that lack support as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, most visitors won’t have any issues with SNI and the group that do is small enough that we can handle them as a special case.</p>\n\n<p>For those browser without SNI support the workaround is to redirect them to a certificate that will work or a snarky “upgrade your browser” page. If you google, you’ll find a bunch of solutions around building whitelists of good browsers and/or blacklists of bad ones and then using those lists in server side redirect rules. Ugly. The lists have to be maintained and depending on the server breaks caching.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a smarter way. While wading through a sea of sample Apache redirect configurations, I found it in this <a href=\"https://www.ebower.com/wiki/Detecting_SNI_with_Apache\">post</a>. The post’s core idea can be distilled down to this, if a browser that doesn’t support SNI tries to load SNI content, it will get an error. If we test this in the background and differentiate between error and success, then we can redirect the visitor accordingly. And the simplest way to do that is to try an add a one pixel image to the page.</p>\n\n<p>In code it looks like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><code class='code'

I’m leveraging two HTML callbacks on the <em>img</em> tag, ‘OnLoad’ which fires when an image finishes loading, and ‘OnError’ which fires if the image can’t be loaded. If a browser doesn’t support SNI then the image will fail to load because of a certificate error, firing ‘OnError’. However, because we are adding the image to an already loaded page, it won’t raise in error in the browser.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can test for SNI and handle lack of support gracefully. Christmas is saved!</p>\n\n<p>However, what we’re really arrived at is something more clever. Notice that the code isn’t actually testing for SNI, just the ability to securely load the image. If the HTTPS URL in question doesn’t actually require SNI, there’s only one cert or the first cert matches the requested domain, it still works. The problem has been reduced to “Can this visitor’s browser display the secure site or not?” and at the end of the day, that’s all that actually care about.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

Well good, we do too, and we think we can do it by building a better business and helping other people do the same.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve venerated <a href=\"http://www.enableimpact.com/\">the people all over the world who work indefatigably to create impactful change in so many different and incredible ways</a> and have often wondered how I could use what we do at dojo4 to do the same. And we have moved vigorously toward focusing our energy on doing just that by partnering with impact enterprises to help with the technology they need to better address the problems they’re solving. But, at the risk of being cloyingly trite,  I’ve realized that one of the essential ways that we can generate real change in the world is be affecting real change in our own lives, families, businesses and communities.</p>\n\n<p>This was on my mind a lot last year as I prepared to give birth to who turned out to be my daughter, Flo. I felt like I had learned so much from building dojo4 over the last years and was looking forward to getting some perspective from the distance I was going to have by taking <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/have-babies-at-dojo4\">maternity leave</a>. I felt (and feel) strongly that no matter what our actual work product had been at dojo4, that just the way we had worked to build a business that really supported the people that comprised it, was in itself a small but potentially powerful way of affecting positive change in our lives and <a href=\"http://one.valeski.org/2013/01/community-anchors-dojo4.html\">in our community</a>. And with that in mind… somehow… within the shocking immersion into new parenthood, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/it-s-business-time-10-tips-for-doing-it-better\">I started writing</a> a little book about building a strong, sustainable and impactful startup.</p>\n\n<p>Once <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/work-after-flo-dojo4\">back at work</a>, it took a good, long time to turn this into a real publication. But, finally, with <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/anthonydimitre\">Anthony Dimitre</a>’s inestimable design talent we got it illustrated. <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/emily-utz\">Emily Utz</a> whipped the 13 final tips into publishable shape. And <a href=\"http://noahelarsen.com/\">Noah</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/UnderpantsGnome\">Michael</a> and <a href=\"http://girleffectaccelerator.com/portfolio/ara-howard\">Ara</a> crafted it into a free, <a href=\"http://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/\">swipe-able book site</a> for your viewing pleasure. I called it <strong>The Little Handbook for Sturdy Startups</strong> and we’re really proud of it!</p>\n\n<p>And just in time for the holidays, it’s now the perfect (although somewhat pricey #selfpublishingmakesitcostoomuch) <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Little-Handbook-Sturdy-Startups-Corey/dp/1320279139/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419022259&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=little+handbook+for+study+startups\">stocking stuffer for all your friends and family on Amazon</a>. Turns out you can change the world just by doing some holiday shopping and leaving a praiseful review on Amazon. ;-)</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

I told him I didn’t have any. Then I saw his smartphone in his hand and asked him about it. He said it was an LG. It was in a nice case. I asked him if he had a decent ability to use his phone and he said yes. I told him that all my money basically flows through my phone now and if he had an app that could easily facilitate a small donation, I’d give him a few pieces of spare change. I told him to invent that app and he could make a million dollars instead of begging for spare change. He didn’t respond. I walked away.</p>\n\n<p>I wondered if someone is already working on this. It looks like <a href=\"http://www.ctagroup.org/\">these guys</a> are working on something similar in Silicon Valley but I think they’re missing the mark a bit by aiming to be the “first place in America where homelessness doesn’t exist.” There are plenty of gated communities, small towns etc. where homelessness doesn’t exist. And, I don’t think this should even be the goal. The goal should be to facilitate a higher quality human experience for those living on the margins through smartphone technology, period.</p>\n\n<p>These guys present this info-graphic that shows a lot of opportunity for purpose-driven entrepreneurs to help those among us in the most need. C’mon, humanity, let’s fix the biggest problems human dignity as our next big thing.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/impact-project-example-idea/assets/c.png' alt=\"Homeless-Cell-Phone-Stats.png\" /> <a href=\"http://forums.techsoup.org/cs/community/b/tsblog/archive/2014/12/09/can-mobile-phones-solve-homelessness.aspx\">img reference</a></p>\n\n<p>My friend who I was walking with suggested I could perhaps just put a few bucks on the guy’s EBT card. “Great Idea”</p>\n\n<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts and/or help you create this vision for our brothers and sisters on the street.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>People love gadgets and gimmicks, especially those that promise to help them get more shit done.  Maybe no single thing ever invented has more potential than the smartphone to liberate people from having fill their brains up with the massive amounts of minutiae <a href=\"/blog/the-big-pivot\">trying to move the needle</a> requires.  The magic of having a CPU, camera, beautiful screen, GPS unit, crazy good navigation, the internet, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/15/wikipedia-rolls-out-a-redesigned-mobile-app/\">all of wikipedia</a>, and even an actual phone in your pocket is truly something straight out of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jetsons\">The Jetsons</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, like all tools, it is the user that decides what to do with it’s potential and the reality is, for 99% of people the phone has become an agent of distraction, entertainment, <a href=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1758465/thumbs/o-MOM-TEXTING-facebook.jpg\">relationship destruction</a> and generally “Not Getting Shit Done” (TM).</p>\n\n<p>Following is my own personal list of techniques for using my phone as a tool instead of a toy:</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"1-clean-that-thing-up\">1) Clean that thing up!</h1>\n\n<p>Move all the Apps you don’t use out of the way, and put ‘first things first’ on your home screen.  Here is a shot of my Android phone’s desktop:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/5-ways-to-make-owning-a-smartphone-less-stupid/assets/b.png' alt=\"android.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>And here’s my iPhone:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/5-ways-to-make-owning-a-smartphone-less-stupid/assets/c.png' alt=\"iPhone.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>No ‘Angry Birds’, no iTunes, just the stuff I Need.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"2-first-things-first\">2) First Things First</h1>\n\n<p>The apps I do choose to keep handy are organized with a very deliberate goal: to GSD (Get Shit Done).</p>\n\n<p>I have all the essential, but minimal, ingredients of my work life striped across the top, organized from <a href=\"http://olivergearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Importance-Vs-Urgency.gif\">‘most urgent, and important’</a> to <a href=\"http://olivergearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Importance-Vs-Urgency.gif\">‘important, but not urgent’</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A Brief explanation of the 4 apps up top:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Calendar.  This is stuff that must happen <em>today</em>, I never put anything on my calendar that isn’t a real, live, hard date so there is rarely anything waiting for me here.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Todoist.  This is my todo list, it’s full of stuff that I’ve planned and should be working on <em>now</em>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Email. A lot of people would put this first, but I don’t like training my mind, or other people’s, to consider email as some sort of realtime todo list.  I check it when I get around to it, and process it into actionable items at that time.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Flowdock: this is our rally point at work, one part instant messaging and one part status board, I drop in here when I need to but, as with email, try not to let it drive my work for the day.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And the 3 down low:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Phone.  I try to use this more than forms of messaging.  People waste a lot of time typing on tiny keyboards when a call would do just fine.  A corollary to making this useful is keeping your contacts up to date and synced.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Messages.  I hate having this on my home screen but a few parts of my life require it.  Most tend to be personal in nature and I’ve capitulated to those people that prefer SMS because of their importance to me.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Camera. The polaroid quality of having a camera connected to the internet cannot be overstated and it’s the thing I miss the most if I’m not carrying a phone.  I snap shots of white boards, things that are broken before heading to the hardware store, dogs, and kids.  A Picture is worth a 1000 words and I try to use mine a <em>lot</em>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"3-shut-up-everyone\">3) Shut up everyone!</h1>\n\n<p>My loathing of bleeping beeping notifications is <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/your-application-s-notifcations-bleeping-beep\">well documented</a>, but the phone is my least favorite notifier.  I absolutely do not need a beep-y digital device interrupting my concentration like some kind of remote control anyone in the world with a a host of stupid apps can activate.</p>\n\n<p>I have notifications for all apps turned 100% off.  My phone makes no noises, no beeps, it has zero badges showing piles of unread stuff.  None of that.</p>\n\n<p>You may be wondering how people get ahold of me who really need to.  That’s actually pretty easy: I’ve installed a silent ring tone as the default for my phone.  This truly wonderful as my phone never rings ;-)  However, I have an audible ring tone assigned to three people:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>My wife</li>\n  <li>My business partner</li>\n  <li>My mom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This let’s me never need to mute my phone and, with all sincerity, interrupt any meeting when my phone rings with a polite “I’m sorry, but I really need to get this” before stepping out and taking what I already know to be an important call.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"4-backup-nothing\">4) Backup nothing</h1>\n\n<p>Although I used to be an avid film photographer I never got into any form of digital photography; the idea that I could fill up a drive with 10,000 photos without caring about the quality or cost was bad enough, but needing to plug the damn thing in was an absolute buzz-kill.  Don’t we have technology for that sort of thing?</p>\n\n<p>Some people are religious about backing up their phones but that is something that needs actually doing, and I’m all about less doing of things.  My approach is simple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Only use apps that sync to the cloud, or otherwise manage their own data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Install DropBox on your phone for a single reason: use the ‘Upload Camera’ feature to ensure that all your photos quietly and automatically migrate off of your phone, and into the safety of your DropBox storage.  This ensures that all those precious photos are out of some stupid gallery application and in safe and simple place where you never have to worry about them.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/5-ways-to-make-owning-a-smartphone-less-stupid/assets/d.png' alt=\"photos.png\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Use <a href=\"http://www.rdio.com/\">Rdio</a> to listen to music.  As my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbrinck\">Ben</a> once said: “owning music is an old fashioned idea.”  I used to own terabytes, yes terabytes, of mp3s.  I used to mess around buying stuff, syncing stuff, and plugging in my phone to realize the magic pile of crap called iTunes.  And then I saw the light: pay Rdio 12 bucks a month, listen to whatever I want, whenever I want.  Store nothing.  Do nothing.  I do sync some stuff to my phone for offline listening, but this is data that I don’t care, or need, to ever backup, should my phone drop into a lake, or the snow, or the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/photogallery/imr/park/grsa/FB1BFF10-155D-451F-67C2FAC1CA54425A/FB1BFF10-155D-451F-67C2FAC1CA54425A.jpg\">great sand dunes</a> (all things which have happened).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"5-write-but-do-not-read\">5) Write, but do not read</h1>\n\n<p>I’m sure some of you are doubting my sincerity here since I do, in fact, post quite a bit of stuff to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drawohara\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ara.t.howard\">Facebook</a> but here is my secret: I use email to post everything.  I do this via our <a href=\"http://mostlovelyart.com/\">family tumblr</a> and Tumblr’s excellent ability to accept posts, including photo posts, via email and relay them to both Twitter and Facebook, and a variety of other methods that let me snap a photo, open up mail, type something quick, hit send, and forget about it.  This has the added advantage that email <em>always</em> works, even when I’m offline.</p>\n\n<p>So, there you have it.  5 ways to make owning a smartphone less stupid or, at least, more conductive to moving your life forward.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><img src='/ro/dojo4/whats-new-in-dojo4--2-version-notes/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"IMG_3766.JPG\" /> Corey Kohn, co-owner of dojo4, and I spoke at length today about the new direction of dojo4. Here is what I learned:</p>\n\n<p>dojo4 is reorganizing as a purpose-driven technology development and design shop, but why?</p>\n\n<p>It has done successful business in service to entrepreneurial efforts over the course of the last 4-5 years. It has refined its lightweight management techniques and developed methods for skillfully peeling back the layers of complexity inherent in any technology problem/solution effort. Its engineers, led by CTO, Ara Howard, make efficient use of financial and human resources by discovering the core interest behind any entrepreneurial goal and executing lightweight solutions quickly and elegantly.</p>\n\n<p>Recently a series of events prompted a welcome opportunity for dojo4’s primary stakeholders to take a step back from the day-to-day grind and reflect on some deeper questions. They’ve considered the role dojo4 is playing in the world and:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the contributions it’s making toward alleviating human suffering.</li>\n  <li>how is it contributing toward solving the humanity’s biggest challenges such as hunger, war, planetary health etc.?</li>\n  <li>how are the members of the dojo4 community growing as humans through the work they do day in and day out?</li>\n  <li>how can we more deeply align with the visions and missions of the entrepreneurs and investors dojo4 works with?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reflecting on these questions, the dojo4 stakeholders realized that they needed something more from the daily work of cranking out one awesome technology solution after another.</p>\n\n<p>So, we’ve have decided to tear down many of the architectural features of the traditional business and rebuild from the foundation up. Here is what we’ve decided to build into the next version dojo4…</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"dojo42\">dojo4.2:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>3 prominent features in the new version</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>dojo4 is restructuring relationships internal to teams and with clients\n \t- <strong>internally</strong>, dojo4 is working to further cultivate rich human relationships within the dojo4 community and within project teams. One expression and practice of this is that <strong><a href=\"http://orgdev.com/\">Org Dev</a></strong> has moved into the dojo4 office and is readily available to assist dojo4’s organizational development as well as others.\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>externally</strong>, dojo4 is keen to build partnerships with entrepreneurs and investors rather than have clients, for a number of reasons. Primary among these is a frustration with the incentives in place in typical client/vendor relationships. dojo4 has found that typical project business structures aren’t conducive to deep and meaningful human relationships. dojo4 believes it can perform better in healthy and rewarding human relationships. Values alignment and mutual investment, either in financial or human capital, are some of the building blocks of these partnerships.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>dojo4 is available to work on impact projects with the right partner on the right project.</li>\n  <li>dojo4 sees an opportunity value to society by contributing toward a functional integration between:\n    <ul>\n      <li>the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/BoulderBCorps/\">social enterprise community</a></li>\n      <li>the <a href=\"http://www.kirschfoundation.org/why/venture.html\">impact investor community</a></li>\n      <li>the <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/welcome.html?destination=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201312/boulder-colorado-fast-growing-business.html\">strong tech/startup community here in Boulder.</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-take-on-all-this\">My Take on all This</h1>\n<p>The primary question I left the interview with was how dojo4 proposes a partnership model with what used-to-be-referred to as “clients.” Partnership implies mutual investment and sense of shared risk and reward in a venture. I would like to see a clear way in dojo4 plans to enter into a shared risk relationship with purpose-driven entrepreneurs. Within the new direction of dojo4 there are a lot questions related to the nuts and bolt of how this will all play out. I’m wondering what a typical or even an ideal “partnership” with an entrepreneur would look like for dojo4. What is the investment opportunity for socially-driven venture capital? What does dojo4 have to invest in a purpose-driven project?</p>\n\n<p>I believe in what dojo4 is doing and want to help see it succeed like some many others that have shown interest in this new direction recently. I even want to contribute/invest my time in helping to bring it to fruition, but how the nuts and bolts come together into an innovative and evolved tech shop are as yet a work in progress. Stay tuned to the blog as this story develops. We’ll be sure to keep folks posted as new structures start gain traction.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>I had a super fun conversation last week with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kdavies24\">Keith Davies</a>, Head of Finance, Risk, and Analytics at <a href=\"http://www.ilovezoona.com/\">Zoona Africa</a>, which is a mobile payments platform committed unlocking the full potential of the African continent.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/move-to-south-africa-for-the-great-tech-jobs/assets/home2.jpg' alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>I was extremely fortunate to get to know the CEO of Zoona, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoonamike\">Mike Quinn</a>, and their Head of Talent, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lelemba\">Lelemba Phiri</a>, at the <a href=\"http://girleffectaccelerator.com/\">the world’s first accelerator dedicated adolescent girls</a>, and I can say that their company represents a best-in-class effort to use technology and solid business principles to make a positive impact on a population that has real demand for it.</p>\n\n<p>Keith and I talked about all manner of things related to building teams, and hiring good people, which is what led me to write this post: they are looking for a top-notch individual to lead a unique opportunity to do data science on an exploding market in an exciting place, and I think DOJO4’s network might reach this person.</p>\n\n<p>So, as promised, here is Keith’s summary, verbatim, about an opportunity to do meaningful work with great people in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>\n\n<p><em>Please share with great people!</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Zoona (<a href=\"http://www.ilovezoona.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.ilovezoona.com</a>) is a growing African payments business with a passion for helping businesses grow by delivering solutions to Micro &amp; Small Enterprises (MSEs). In countries like Zambia, businesses of all sizes struggle to grow because of challenges transacting in cash, low access to affordable finance and poor and unreliable data. By combining a set of affordable and accessible working capital finance products with a real-time, electronic payments platform, customers are able to transact in an easy, quick and safe way.</p>\n\n<p>Zoona has a sustainable business model and is backed by quality, international investors. We have grown to process millions of dollars in payment value each month in pursuit of our vision of Cashless Growing Businesses…everywhere!</p>\n\n<p>Here are some videos to help make this more tangible</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/114721782\" target=\"_blank\">http://vimeo.com/114721782</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrpO-uGz_XE\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrpO-uGz_XE</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From a data perspective, Zoona is in the enviable position of gathering data on sectors of society where there is very little formal data.  We can therefore use this data to improve our products and services and thereby build financial inclusion (which is considered to be one of the most impactful poverty relief interventions) in these communities.  We have built a data team and proved the value that data can bring to both our business and our customers.  We are now looking to add a strong data scientist to our team that will lead in taking data insights and predictive capabilities to the forefront of our business.  The right person will have deep technical skills and have a burning desire to leverage their skills in a new, socially impactful way.</p>\n\n<p>The position will be based in Cape Town at the tip of South Africa.  Cape Town is a beautiful, cosmopolitan city, with myriad activities to choose from, from great night life to hiking, surfing, sailing, kite-boarding, mountain biking trail running, golf etc and a climate to match.  That is not to even mention the world class (and cheap) food and wine in and around the city.  Cape Town is also emerging as a tech hub with a vibrant startup community. By way of example, Amazon AWS has emerged from and is based out of Cape Town.</p>\n\n<p>This is an incredibly exciting opportunity for anybody who is looking to utilise their cutting edge skills in an industry that is making great strides at sustainablly alleviating poverty.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds interesting to you, please get in touch with me at <a href=\"mailto:keith@zoona.co.za\" target=\"_blank\">keith@zoona.co.za</a></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>From: orgdev \nTo: Boulder/Denver Tech Community \nre: Your opinion</p>\n\n<p>First some context. Starting Jan.1 2015 my co-founder Sam Elmore and I moved our business into our own space in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dojo4/@40.019839,-105.273477,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xd1e17a53bc1c8230?hl=en-US\">downtown Boulder</a>. We are in the same building as <a href=\"http://dojo.com\">dojo4</a> who are our clients, family &amp; friends. Operation <strong>hang out a shingle</strong>: check.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/orgdev-wants-you/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"IMG_4794.JPG\" /></p>\n\n<p>So what happens under said shingle? Ok, just a little more context (I swear). Sam and I created <a href=\"http://orgdev.com\">orgdev</a> for the expressed purpose of creating the <em>human</em> conditions for doing our best work. With our backgrounds in <a href=\"http://naropa.edu\">psychology</a>, <a href=\"http://aliainstitute.org/\">authentic leadership</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/training.html\">mindful/awareness practice</a>, <a href=\"http://www.playbacktheatrewest.com/\">theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8\">life</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I#t=43\">the school of hard knocks</a> etc. we have been trying to hack at the question of what supports individuals and teams in doing their best work… from the human point of view. Many efforts are made to support people from work flow/ productivity/ accountability/ and so on. Ours is an interest in the human beings themselves, not just their output (based on the understanding that you cannot separate the two). I think we’ve all had the experience where things just click, and we are “on” and our work with others is healthy, productive, and enjoyable. AND, sometimes things really just don’t click…or worse. So what’s up with that?</p>\n\n<p>(Generally, when I explain my work to people I get responses like: “better you then me,” or “that is so difficult and so important,” or “good luck.” However, both Sam and I relish difficult problems, and find that working this material is the same thing as feeling alive.)</p>\n\n<p>Ok so, again, what happens at orgdev?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>We consult in an ongoing way, primarily with tech companies on intentional culture enhancement.</li>\n  <li>We design and execute company retreats.</li>\n  <li>We host and lead events and conversations about the intersection of our humanity and our work.</li>\n  <li>We host trainings in methods of facilitation and human skill development.</li>\n  <li>We coach individuals through the trials and tribulations of being human at work.</li>\n  <li>We guide people and companies through transitions.</li>\n  <li>We play.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now this is where your opinion comes in…we are looking for targeted feedback on a new offering: <strong>facilitated peer groups</strong> for folks of similar work stations. The purpose of these gatherings will be: to connect with peers, to support mentorship, to have a context to workshop some of the harder challenges we have in our work, to develop new skills and competencies and to have a space where one can be fully transparent about all aspects of their job . A critical human condition for doing our best work is connection. And yet very few resources exist for CTO’s, COO’s or Managers of engineers  to connect with one another. We plan to fill in this gap by creating peer groups of 6-8 people who meet on a regular cadence.</p>\n\n<p>Our direct network has responded very positively to the idea, and now we are taking our questions about this to a broader audience. So that means you. We would be so grateful if you could fill out our survey gauging both the desire for and shape that these groups could take so that what we offer actually fits the needs of the people who may use it. Please find the survey embedded in this blog post. It takes 2-4 minutes. Fill it out, share it with your networks… after-all we are smack dab in the middle of the <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/28-days-of-kindness\">28 days of Kindness campaign</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again. And keep you ears to the ground as orgdev and dojo4 may be throwing an awesome shingle/b-corp party soon…</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D45nGBAQwqKt7Dkn2hc6ulJbiiyFYVO7qeXBZtoUbtk/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"760\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading...</iframe>\n\n\n</div>\n",

Why do they matter? And why is there a great future in B Corps?</p>\n\n<p>B Lab, the nonprofit that provides the  certification to businesses, <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps\">describe B Corps thusly</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B Corp is to business what Fair Trade certification is to coffee or USDA Organic certification is to milk. B Corps are certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.)\nToday, there is a growing community of more than 1,000 Certified B Corps from 33 countries and over 60 industries working together toward 1 unifying goal: to redefine success in business</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>dojo4 just went through the certification process and we are now proud to be a <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/community/dojo4\">bona fide B Corp</a>. Having worked on a farm in a former life, I thought of it very much like getting an organic certification. As a farmer you may already shun the use of pesticides and practice other environmentally sustainable farming methods, but an organic certification lets people know that you are sticking to a set of standards and gives you guidelines for ensuring the purity of the land you work and the food you produce. In our case, as a technology and design company, we already rejected being purely profit-driven and set out to do business with the recognition that we are all interdependent. By getting the B Corp certification, we are letting people know that we are backing up this understanding of interdependence with a standard of practice and are giving ourselves the support of guidelines to stick to (or aspire to).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bimpactassessment.net/\">The assessment</a> is a real doozy (our application was 50+ pages long and took us a year to achieve), but the application process itself got us on our game and we are already seeing the benefits of being certified. There are lots of reasons to become certified, but here are at least 5 bennies that you can expect:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>It’s great marketing.</strong> It’s a brilliant way of proclaiming who you are, what’s meaningful for your company, and what you stand for. You are letting people know that care about human and environmental health and integrity. Like-minded clients, partners, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304868404579193973525834320\">prospective employees</a>, and customers are looking for you. This helps them find you.</li>\n  <li><strong>It makes you be even better.</strong> In order to become a B Corp, your organization has to get  score of at least 80 out of 200 on the stringent <a href=\"http://bimpactassessment.net/\">Impact Assessment</a>. Even <a href=\"http://bestfortheworld.bcorporation.net/index.html\">the highest scorers</a> tend to achieve a rating in the lower 100s (we scored 88.5- a pass!), which means that even the best of us can aspire to do better. A B Corp certification helps you stick to guidelines that you can feel good about adhering to. It provides a set of standards to make you better at what you are already setting out to do.</li>\n  <li><strong>It puts you in good company.</strong> Becoming a B Corp lets you <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/10/14/how-small-company-can-join-ranks-etsy-and-patagonia\">join the ranks for other companies doing great things</a>. This isn’t just good marketing, B Corps also respect and share with each other, which is good for business and good for the ecology of a socially responsible economy.</li>\n  <li><strong>It supports and includes you in a thriving movement.</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHGCvJjat1E\">Just one word(s)</a>: B Corps. Triple bottom line businesses, that set specific standards for social and environmental performance, are <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/supercharging_the_b_corp_movement\">where it’s at</a>.</li>\n  <li><strong>It let’s you, rather than your shareholders, decide what’s best.</strong> By becoming a B corp, your company declares its dedication to valuing the interests of stakeholders as much as (or more than) the interests of its shareholders. In this way, being a B Corp provides a company with <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/companies-benefits\">some protection against pressure from investors</a>. It <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PlaceFuture/benefit-corp-b-corp-b-lab-b-impact-b-3cfd8528e1e6\">makes it clear to your shareholders from the get go</a> that your bottom line will always include people, planet and profit.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>No time like the present to give your company the benefits of becoming a B Corp - don’t let <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Pbx9mvWPY\">the way of the future</a> pass you by.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.

I’m pretty sure I did that every single day - even on the days I didn’t eat, sleep or poop.</p>\n\n<p>When you have a kid, eating and sleeping every day is unlikely (thanks to sleepless nights of the stomach flu), so I think my next goal will be <strong>#365poop</strong>. Baby steps, people.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jwatsoncreative\">@jessicawatson</a>, are you in, you damned day-maker?  ; )</p>\n\n<p>In all seriousness, though, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/430758197076608/453994228086338/?notif_t=plan_mall_activity\">28 Days of Kindness</a> has highlighted for me both how innate the daily kindnesses that family and friendship require are, as well as how much effort it takes to step outside of my comfort zone and extend kindness to strangers.  It’s been deeply thought-provoking and inspiring to participate - and worthwhile any day, even if I can’t pull it off everyday.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/number-365poop/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"wonderlandview.jpg\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

I’d start the song over and give you my other earbud so we can listen together, but you’re across town or across the country or across the world. Too sad!</p>\n\n<p>We helped <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/youngbrad\">Brad Young</a> solve this problem by building <a href=\"http://gosyncd.com/\">GoSyncd</a>, a music sharing platform that allows you to share any track from <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com\">SoundCloud</a> in real-time with anyone and everyone. <a href=\"http://gosyncd.com/\">GoSyncd</a> just launched this week with this promise: “You’ll never share headphones again. Same song. Same time. All your friends.”</p>\n\n<p>The project provided some interesting challenges around syncing and gave us a chance to play with the <a href=\"https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide\">SoundCloud API</a>. It was also the first time we’ve used <a href=\"https://pusher.com/\">Pusher</a> for a project. The service simplifies sending notifications between servers and browsers and directly between browsers. There are lots of ways to do this, but <a href=\"https://pusher.com/\">Pusher</a> provides a clean API and falls back to handle browsers that don’t modern notification techniques</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gosyncd.com/\">GoSyncd</a> is a nice interface for searching for and playing music from SoundCloud. It was fun to build and makes it even more sweet to listen together!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>It’s been our recent privilege to be doing some design and development for <a href=\"http://caloriecloud.org/\">Calorie Cloud</a> to support the work they’re doing with <a href=\"http://www.unicefusa.org/\">UNICEF USA</a> in a series of programs being rolled out in over 1300 schools in New York, Boston and Dallas this month. <a href=\"http://www.unicefkidpower.org/\">The program</a>, first piloted in New York and <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/kings/news/kings-mayor-johnson-unicef-launch-kid-power\">Sacramento</a> in 2014, gets American kids to be active, which then directly benefits under-nourished children in the developing world. Classrooms compete against each other to be the most active, and <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/02/25/unicef-kid-power/\">for every so many units of activity measured by the Calorie Cloud activity wristbands</a>, UNICEF sends lifesaving <a href=\"http://mananutrition.org/what-is-mana-whats-rutf\">RUTFs</a> to severely malnourished children around the world.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/getting-our-kids-in-shape-never-felt-so-good/assets/b.png' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-02-25 at 1.12.57 PM.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"http://frac.org/initiatives/hunger-and-obesity/obesity-in-the-us/\">1 in 3 American school-aged children being overweight</a> and <a href=\"http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Childhood_Obesity_Infograph.jpg\">less than 5% of U.S. elementary schools offering physical education programs</a>, it’s not surprising that <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/28710516347879737/\">the USA has one of the highest level of childhood obesity in the world</a>. These <a href=\"http://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp\">numbers</a> mean that there may be more overweight children in the US in 2015 than the \n[approximately 20 million children that are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition this year] (<a href=\"http://mananutrition.org/severe-acute-malnutrition\" target=\"_blank\">http://mananutrition.org/severe-acute-malnutrition</a>). So these programs, designed by Calorie Cloud, create the conditions for an ingenious win/win for children facing very different, but parallel and exceptionally challenging health problems.</p>\n\n<p>“Malnutrition is responsible for over a third of all deaths of children under the age of five globally. By putting children first, we believe we can reach a day when no child dies of a cause we know how to prevent,” said <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/unicef-launches-new-kid-power-program-empowering-american-youth-to-get-active-and-save-lives-around-the-world-300041224.html\">U.S. Fund for UNICEF President and CEO Caryl M. Stern</a>. “I can’t think of a better motivator for kids to get active than the fact that they’re helping save lives. We’re grateful to the cities of New York, Boston and Dallas, their sports teams and all the teachers, students and parents who are getting involved in helping malnourished children get the treatment they need to survive.”</p>\n\n<p>We worked with Calorie Cloud and UNICEF to hone and implement the design for the site and mobile app, collaborating with their teams to make the UX intuitive and working within the UNICEF branding guidelines to make the design compelling. We also pulled in some Tumblr and Zendesk integrations and got the whole thing in nicely deployable form for their team to work with as the program expands. The Calorie Cloud team was truly great to work with- and we’re happy to have another project underway with them… more on that soon!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

As I could feel the bonk starting to set in I knew my only hope of being any kind of good company for Ara was to get him talking and that I did.</p>\n\n<p>I essentially asked Ara to take it from the top and tell me the story of DOJO4 and how it has come to repositioning itself as the the go-to mission driven tech design/dev shop.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"childhood\">Childhood</h1>\n\n<p>Ara took it from the top and began with a full character development of his grandmother, who by no stretch of the imagination is a strong candidate for an Alaskan Catholic Saint. She taught Ara formative values early in life such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>never complain (it’s a demonstration of weakness)\nalways return a borrowed item in better condition than you found it.</li>\n  <li>build community with saints and sinners alike (everyone is worthy of forgiveness)</li>\n  <li>respect adults and practice good manners\nwork harder than everyone you know</li>\n  <li>take other people’s perceived limitations as fuel for your own tenacity (she lived for 30 years after doctors told her she only had 3 years left with Hepatitis C)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ara explained to me that helping others, caring for the disadvantaged and the planet were values as basic as the water he grew up drinking. Yet, his athletic successes drew him down the path of personal excellence and achievement throughout his college and early post-college years until his life altering bicycle crash and injury. In an instant he broke his back in multiple places his hip and ribs he realized that he would have to find work that didn’t require him to to be a world class athlete.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"code\">Code</h1>\n<p>Since Ara was always good in math, he went back to college for a computer science degree and was the top of every class he took. From there he took a job programming satellite for NOAA and worked several of his colleagues out of their jobs. He didn’t think that was fair so he quit and worked with an elite team of 5 working on highly classified night sky data analytics with one of the webs most prophetic pioneers and open source champions.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"dojo4\">DOJO4</h1>\n\n<p>After a stint with the <a href=\"http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/night_sat/nightsat.html\">night sky project</a>, Ara started contracting and from there was inspired to start an agency that would elegantly combine design and development into one team and under one roof. He spotted the future DOJO4 building moments after having the formative conversation with DOJO4’s first designer, phone calls were made, the founding team was assembled, and DOJO4 was born.</p>\n\n<p>In the first few months founders were shuffled around. Corey Kohn replaced Jeffrey. Eventually, Justin and Dave left the ownership team.  Over the years DOJO4 has explored and experimented with several different small-agency business models including shared equity with clients, hourly pay structures, fixed bids, employee designers and developers, contractor-based teams, in-house products, and various project management tools and practices.</p>\n\n<p>After surveying everything they could get their hands on in the tech world and building countless technology solutions for entrepreneur after entrepreneur, Ara and Corey are feeling a tug back to their humanitarian roots. They are hearing the call to purpose and meaning in the work of programming that they drank deeply of earlier in their careers.</p>\n\n<p>Ara attended the <a href=\"http://girleffectaccelerator.com/\">Girl Effect Accelerator</a> conference in San Francisco recently on Corey’s prompting and was heartened to see that there are still companies doing amazingly impactful work all over the planet and solving compelling global challenges, despite the zeitgeist in the U.S. tech communty for solving problems no one has and then figuring out how to make people want them: some people are still solving real problems!</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"pivot-noir\">Pivot-Noir</h1>\n\n<p>Ara called Corey on the phone after a late night of communion with inspiring foreign entrepreneurs and told her that he wanted to work on projects like these from now on. Corey was in after hearing 30 seconds of Ara’s pitch.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-view\">My View</h1>\n\n<p>Seeking to bring deeper meaning and purpose into one’s life and work is a primary agenda of modern times. So Ara and Corey and the DOJO4 crew aren’t alone in this. As Ara pointed out in an earlier conversation, helping others is a primary contributor to happiness but alas for most of us in Boulder, life is relatively comfy. Is helping a fellow entrepreneur build the next social forum really a global priority and challenge? Maybe, if it’s meant to organize a sharing economy in the third world. If you’re working on this, [contact us] (mailto:<a href=\"mailto:corey@dojo4.com\" target=\"_blank\">corey@dojo4.com</a>) and we’ll find a way to make it work.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><img src='/ro/dojo4/family-friendly-workplace-manifesto/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"IMG_9264_for-web.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Whereas being parents or caretakers, having a family, is something that we should be able to celebrate and have pride in at work, we declare this <strong>Family-Friendly Workplace Manifesto</strong>. Having a family provides joy and challenge. It should not be something that anyone feels the need to hide, justify, explain away or be embarrassed about.</p>\n\n<p>Parents and other caretakers have the right conditions to be some of our most valuable co-workers and employees, because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>they have no choice but to be used to and conditioned for hard work and a relentless schedule</li>\n  <li>they have a lot at stake and are likely to be working not necessarily for themselves but for the greater welfare of their families</li>\n  <li>their home lives emphasize the need for clear decision-making, collaboration and the inescapable need to be able to play well with others</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because of this, family-friendly workplaces have the potential to be more profitable, effective and efficient workplaces. A workplace that values families, is a happier, more realistic and more sustainable workplace. It is more likely to retain good employees. It is more likely to generate good will, a resource that can be drawn on when it is needed most.</p>\n\n<p>To engender a family-friendly work place, we declare the following…</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>We recognize that life happens. Recurrent sickness, snow days, school holidays, child-care fails, school and doctors appointments, and emergencies of all kinds are part of the fabric of life and cannot be disappeared. The work will get done at another time soon.</li>\n  <li>Having children in the workplace, from time to time, makes it a richer place. Small beings may be distracting, but it is good for our co-workers to know our families and our families to know our coworkers. It provides potential role models for our children. It provides potential humor and playfulness for our co-workers. And sometimes it is just best, in the big picture, to have our children with us rather than the drain on logistical resources that it would take to figure out where else they can be.</li>\n  <li>We acknowledge that there is undue burden on single parents, financially disadvantaged parents, parents or caretakers of those with special needs, breast-feeding mothers and parents of sleep-depriving infants. Acknowledging this does not imply a lower standard of expectation but allows for the understanding of a different set of demands.</li>\n  <li>A healthy family demands a particular kind of schedule. Work and meetings scheduled at the last minute or during the time needed to get children off to daycare/school or during dinner or bedtime are not necessarily going to be doable or productive for parents. A workplace that supports flexible schedules and the ability to work remotely will optimize and capitalize on the good work that parents/caretakers have to offer. We now live in a world that offers many tools for productive, asynchronous team work - we will take advantage of them to support a healthier, more inclusive and more generative workplace.</li>\n  <li>Providing <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/have-babies-at-dojo4\">paid parental leave</a> is integral to the structure of a family-friendly workplace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This manifesto is under Creative Commons license and open-sourced through <a href=\"https://github.com/dojo4/policy/blob/master/family-friendly_workplace_manifesto\">GitHub</a>.

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><strong>The Power of Passion Projects</strong></p>\n\n<p>I’ve long been in the habit of asking people “what are you passionate about?” verses “what do you do?” When you ask this question, in the right circumstances, you’ll get juicy nuggets of wisdom, experience, and things happening behind the scenes. It’s tough to define a person by his or her job, and more authentic to think about the bigger picture.</p>\n\n<p>Many say I’m fortunate enough to do work that I love. And while I agree, I don’t want to downplay that it took a lot of time, commitment and dedication to set my life up this way. Even with a profession that I love, I still have side projects. I’ve nicknamed this “Passion Projects,” which I deem things that you pour your heart and soul into, things that you spend hours on, and things that you’re probably not getting paid for (and perhaps you’re not looking to get paid for). These are projects that you simply just believe in. You usually are trying to fill a need or a void, to solve a problem, to make something better. And that, far outweighs the long nights, or trying to squeeze it in around an already tight schedule.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-power-of-passion-projects/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"dojo4-passionproject.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>With a passion project, you get to take your skill set beyond the office, and apply it to something where you can see direct impact and results and where you can react in real time. Over time, a passion project could generate some income, get you recognition, and open the door to larger opportunities. But, more often than not, it could take years if it happens at all, and that’s not why you’re in the game. If you retrace the steps of some of the unique things happening in your community, or follow some of the spinoffs created by successful business owners, you’ll learn that a lot of these scenarios started as ideas. They started as some wild idea that perhaps no one believed in. They started as the thing that kept someone up at night, or the faint notion that something indeed might be possible, if there was one out there willing to dedicate the time and advocate for it. These are not accidents.</p>\n\n<p>You probably have unique ideas floating around in your mind right now, that perhaps for whatever reason you’ve decided not to explore. Let’s recap and rethink this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT IS A PASSION PROJECT?</strong>\nA passion project is a task, not bound by normal constraints of time and resources, based on an idea that could solve a problem and better something in some way. It’s the sketches in your notebook, it’s the “what if?” factor. It’s often something only you can see at first, but slowly as you work through the project, others will rally behind you as well. There are no size restrictions, but the standard advice is to think big while starting small. Not all passion projects bring wild success or sustain a legacy, but they are still worth exploring. As an additional note, make sure you’re in it for the right reasons, as authenticity is highly valued here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHY ARE THESE PROJECTS IMPORTANT?</strong>\nBecause you should be more than the sum of your 9-to-5, or your home life, or your current circumstances and situation. Because you have talents and abilities that can be put to use beyond the classroom or the office. Because this is the free space that we used to have as children, where anything was possible, where we could use what we knew to create, to adjust, and to achieve. Because win or lose, you’re getting in touch with a different side of yourself, and you’re affecting those around you by pursuing your project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU START ONE?</strong>\nStart small. Think of your skills (this can be as far fetching as “I’m a developer” or as simple as “I have good organization skills.”). Think of something that interests you. Look in your community. Ask around. Look beyond your community, perhaps other places around the country or world. Are there opportunities for you to reach out, to get involved, to start a conversation?</p>\n\n<p>Start with a blank page and then fill it in with your thoughts. There’s something lingering in your mind, something that doesn’t add up. Write about it. Sketch it out. Is it solvable?</p>\n\n<p>Find others. You are not alone. There’s actually a tribe of folks (oh yeah, I said <em>tribe</em>) who support various different causes, and applaud people who put in the time or effort to make something better. Passionate people will get excited about what you’re working on, offer constructive feedback, share life experiences, as well as what they’re working on too.</p>\n\n<p>There’s an undefined world out there, that doesn’t fit within most of what is structured, but still has notable qualities that you can apply to all areas of your life. It’s the world where you feel enabled and empowered to make a shift, and to get things done.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re still stuck on what you can do, join up with another cool project and get your feet wet (search the start-up and volunteer scenes for starters). Eventually, I promise you, the ideas will start flowing. And what happens next, could change your world.</p>\n\n<p><em>My passion projects of the moment include <a href=\"http:/www.28daysofkindness.com/\">28 Days of Kindness</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1413233662313531/\">the Have A Nice Day Project</a>.</em></p>\n\n</div>\n",

When asked why, he shared that, “Volunteering my time/energy and giving back to the world/community is very important to me and was ingrained in me from an early age by my mother. Growing up we volunteered with Children’s Home Society in San Diego to help those at a disadvantage in society. When I moved to Boulder I wanted to continue giving back in some way and found Boulder Food Rescue. Food waste and misallocation of resources are major issues worldwide and are important for me to address and be involved in in any way that I can. This was a way I can be involved in volunteering, saving food from going into the garbage can and moving it to people in need while keeping a low carbon footprint. Wins all around!”</p>\n\n<p>In the good ‘ol US of A food waste is arguably a much bigger problem than food shortage.  A comprehensive report from <a href=\"http://endhunger.org/food-waste/\">endhunger.org</a> notes that in 2010, “31% of the 430 billion pounds of the available food supply at the retail and consumer levels went uneaten.” Translation: over half of the daily recommended caloric intake for grown men, much less children, was thrown in the trash.  Meanwhile, <em>1 in 6</em> Americans experiences food insecurity–aka: hunger.</p>\n\n<p>Given this reality, we hope <em>every</em> town and city in America will found it’s own Food Rescue. BFR is <a href=\"http://www.boulderfoodrescue.org/index.php/start-your-own-food-rescue/\">making that possible</a> through advocacy, mentorship and leveraging technology for good. Check out their open sourced <a href=\"https://github.com/somerandomsequence/food-rescue-robot\">Food Rescue Robot</a>, already being used in at least 22 cities.  The Robot reports that Rylan has clocked about 90 pickups, 9,000lbs of rescued food and counting.</p>\n\n<p>If this peaks your curiousity about food justice work locally–and we hope it does–go to the <a href=\"http://www.boulderfoodrescue.org/index.php/forward-food-summit/\">Forward Food Summit</a> next month over at <a href=\"http://www.impacthubboulder.com/\">Impact Hub Boulder</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/dojo4-ninja-rescues-boulders-food/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"Forward-Food-Poster.jpg\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>The dojo crew had a great conversation at last week’s <a href=\"http://dojo4.eventbrite.com\">Community Happy Hour</a> with our most <a href=\"http://unreasonable.is/\">Unreasonable</a> friend, Daniel Epstein. Everything from nanotech to the downsides of polyphasic sleeping were discussed, but the real takeaway for me was this:</p>\n\n<p><em>In order to get technologists to use their enormous power for good (in other words, to solve real problems that serve humanity and the earth, rather than just convenience, profit or entertainment) we need to shift from the bottom up and the top down simultaneously.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/wanted-gnu-unreasonable-nerds/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"DanielInterview.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In talking about this major cultural shift that’s needed, Daniel spoke to the importance of having heroes who demonstrate that <strong>IT IS POSSIBLE</strong> to abandon the old model of making all your money so that you can someday be a generous philanthropic do-gooder, and instead make your money by doing good now. For example, we need more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk\">Elon Musks</a> who break rules, break trail and inspire others to follow.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard\">Ara</a> noted that this is a top-down model of change: a relative few Unreasonable heroes break the mold and their audacity trickles down, inspiring a mass movement–we hope!</p>\n\n<p>He spoke of the early days of nerd-dom, during which time punk rock abounded and the rapid appearance of decentralized, non-proprietary new technology empowered nerds to effect significant social change. At that time, nerd culture inspired some pretty extreme leftist thinking, but how many of us working in tech today know much about <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-gnu-manifesto-turns-thirty\">Richard Stahllman or his 1985 <em>GNU Manifesto</em></a>, for example?</p>\n\n<p>Since then–and there’s no nice way to put this–the nerds sold out. Most people aren’t thinking about revolution or even evolution, they’re just trying to make bank off building ads, apps or worse.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel is an undaunted optimist though, and believes the pendulum will–and is–swinging back. That said, there’s no getting around the fact that people need to make money, and usually want to make lots of it.  So, we have to both demonstrate that it’s possible to do so while doing good, <em>and</em> re-empower nerd culture to realize its own power and potential to, as Daniel says, put a positive dent on history.</p>\n\n<p>The moral of the story for those of us who hold the awesome power of technology in our very hands: stop tinkering with the entertainment system on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth\">Spaceship Earth</a> and start fixing something on-board that will sustain life (i.e. yours).</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/wanted-gnu-unreasonable-nerds/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"Spaceship Earth 00.jpg\" /></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>(This post originally appears on Spike’s <a href=\"http://stuff-things.net/\">Stuff… And Things… blog</a>)</p>\n\n<p>While the fame and free cars are nice, the reason I blog is to learn, or, as in this case, to help me remember things.</p>\n\n<p>I work across a number of distinct Rails projects that share a common ancestry. Often a bug fix or a new feature in one needs to be ported to (some of) the others.</p>\n\n<p>Because projects all live in their own repos, the changes can not be merged using Git. No, this is a job for patches. And when it comes to patching with Git, there are two posts about the process I can not live without.</p>\n\n<p>When patching, three Git commands that come into play, <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch\">git format-patch</a>, <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply]\">git apply</a>, and the somewhat obscure <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/docs/git-am\">git am</a>.</p>\n\n<p><code>git patch</code> is pretty straight forward, give a list of commits, it generates a diff in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_%28Unix%29\">patch format</a> which can then be applied by Git or by the patch command. The thing I always have to look up is the shortcut to get a patch from the last commit.</p>\n\n<p>The non-shortcut way is to get the SHA of the second to last commit and pass it to format-patch. Why the second to last? The SHA represents the state of the repo after the commit is made, thus the final SHA is where we are now, and the second to last where we where before our changes.</p>\n\n<p>We generate the patch thusly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git log --oneline\n975d4dc Auto-generated CHANGELOG.md\nca1216d Bump for validation fix\ngit format-patch ca1216d\n0001-Auto-generated-CHANGELOG.md.patch\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You can also create multiple patches by using a SHA further back in the history.)</p>\n\n<p>However, there’s shortcut to get the second to last commit that I found log ago in this post:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9396240/how-do-i-simply-create-a-patch-from-my-latest-git-commit\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9396240/how-do-i-simply-create-a-patch-from-my-latest-git-commit</a> and is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git format-patch HEAD^\n0001-Auto-generated-CHANGELOG.md.patch\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>HEAD^</code> is short for <code>HEAD^1</code>, the <em>^1</em> means the first parent of the commit, in this case commit before <em>HEAD</em>, which is, of course, the second to last commit.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you have you patch you need to apply it. For that, I reach for the advice found in <a href=\"https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/\">https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/</a></p>\n\n<p>First you can use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git apply --stat patch-file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to see what changes are actually in the patch. Then you can use</p>\n\n<pre><code>git apply --check patch-file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to see if it will actually work.</p>\n\n<p>However, per Ariejan’s article, I don’t actually use <code>git apply</code> to apply the patch. Why not? Attribution.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative to <em>apply</em> is <code>git am</code>, which is designed to apply patches from email(s). What makes it different is that the committer on the commit is taken from the <em>From</em> address in the patch. For patches the created by <code>git format-patch</code> this is the committer of the original code. With <code>git apply</code> you are the committer. Thus, if you use <code>git am</code>, you get a record of who wrote the code and with <code>git apply</code> a record of who applied the patch.</p>\n\n<p>Which bring us to the <code>--signoff</code> option. Passed to <code>git am</code> it adds <em>Signed-off-by</em> containing the name of the person applying the patch to the <code>git log</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>git am --signoff &lt; patch file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With that we get both, a commit that shows who wrote the code and who applied it to this repo.</p>\n\n<p>And now maybe I’ll be able to remember it!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

That’s not to say that there aren’t a lot of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/22-powerful-women-engineers-in-tech-2014-7?op=1\">very talented and influential</a> female entrepreneurs and coders out there. But even if you are blind, deaf and socially oblivious, you know that the tech scene is a male-populated and dominated field. Computer engineers are far more likely to have a Y chromosome than not. With <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/26/report-the-number-of-women-entering-computing-took-a-nosedive/\">only about 18% of computer-science graduates from engineering schools being women and that number actually dropping</a>, rather than the other way around, it means that <a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2011/08/31/the-10-commandments-of-brogramming/\">bro-gramming</a> is still the norm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The tempting response to this situation is to try to find are the root causes and then solve them.</strong> Where does the problem stem from? Is it because of a lack of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/03/15/solving-the-pipeline-problem-how-to-get-more-women-in-tech/\">training</a>? Skewed <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-013-0296-x\">media representation</a>?

There are lots and lots of answers to these questions, with thousands of dollars and <a href=\"https://www.ncwit.org/\">whole institutes</a> dedicated to figuring them out. But the fact of the matter remains: there is a gross gender imbalance in field of information technology.</p>\n\n<p>So, is this in fact a problem? To answer that, I’ll take my immediate situation as a case study. As a woman I am in the minority of people that work with dojo4. And none of the us women are in a strictly technical job here. Even though I went to college as a math wiz to study math and biology at the tender age of 16, I didn’t like the way sciences were taught and ended up majoring in Medical Anthropology, and then later getting a graduate degree in Communications. And now I find myself running a dev and design shop powered by male engineers (who I love and appreciate). Many a day I see no problem with the way things are- I am relating day-to-day with the people I work with, and gender is not at the forefront of my mind. I love my job, enjoy the company of my coworkers and business partner, feel empowered and confident in my work, and feel comfortable being ‘who I am’ in the workplace. But as someone educated in the age of post-structuralist feminism and gender studies, and having thought about this stuff a bit, I recognize that there is a whole panoply of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/opinion/urry-women-science/\">implicit biases</a> and <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/katiecunningham/the-million-little-barbs-of-lighten-up\">imbalances</a> going on that do not necessarily support the model of an enlightened system. The main point, however, that sticks out for me is that although I rarely feel put upon, excluded or objectified, I do feel lonely sometimes and I wonder what it would be like to have more women around.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that we don’t know what it would be like if there were a more even balance of the genders. <strong>How would the tech field be different if there were more women involved</strong>, in general, and as technologists, specifically?  Would there be more innovation? Might there be more creativity? Would there be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/hearing-womens-voices\">a different set of users being served</a>? Would there be more <a href=\"http://blog.mindjet.com/2013/04/gender-equality-and-productivity/\">productivity</a> or <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/17/us-un-women-economy-idUSKBN0MD0JJ20150317\">happiness</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/gender-diversity-business-study_n_5945312.html\">increased profits</a> in tech workplaces? What would it be like if I or any of my co-workers could consult with another woman here at dojo4? What would it be like to do collaborative work with her to build technology?</p>\n\n<p>These are all powerful questions, the answers to which could have powerful results. We can commit ourselves to hiring more women, to inviting more women to be collaborators, ask more women to mentor us. And we can also make a more conscious effort to understand gender as a spectrum rather than a binary factor and that that there are no simple solutions of balancing numbers of men and women. Some people now define feminism as the effort to <a href=\"http://thewebivore.com/make-everything-better-for-everyone-feminism-for-2012/\">make everything better for everyone</a>. So <strong>what can we do now to see what it might feel like if there were more women in tech, and to make everything better for everyone?</strong></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

But that’s just because you never bothered to RTFM when it comes to what ‘transaction’ means.  Start here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/transaction-iso.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/transaction-iso.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Note that little table.  Let me translate it for you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Because <em>you</em> don’t have every <em>single</em> sequence of <em>read&amp;write</em> wrapped in a transaction, and sometimes just sling code against your ORM objects directly, you suffer from the ‘scary’ reality of ‘read-uncommitted’ mentioned in the article</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Because <em>you</em> rely on the default isolation level you suffer from both non-repeatable-reads and phantom reads. (Do you even know what the default isolation is for your db and what that means????)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Because <em>you</em> didn’t set your transaction level to ‘serializable’ you falsely believe your database is fast and safe.  You’ve wrongly relied on the database to provide data integrity as an abstraction that does not require critical thinking and application code at least 10 times better than yours.  You have all the scary features of Kyle’s article in your RDBMS backed apps - and, not only do you <em>not know this</em> you are <em>pretty sure your data is ‘safe’</em></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And so I ask you which is a worse engineering decision:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Pick a standards based tool that everyone is <em>very</em> confident they understand and know how to use safely but, in it’s common usage, virtually never guarantees that which believe it promises and, furthermore, has been widely <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_%28database_systems%29#Default_isolation_level\">critized as having ambiguous and inaccurate semantics</a> ?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Or to accept what has always been true: that by themselves, databases cannot provide abstractions that mean non-extremely-clever developers can’t trivally screw things up. And that data integrity is a domain specific concept that must be implemented at the application layer, with only a small part of that integrity being aided by the choice of database.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ps.  I’ve worked on large scale financial, realtime, and HA systems that use both Mongo and PostgreSQL.  It’s damn hard either way.</p>\n\n<p>pss.

And there is an even bigger difference between being busy and getting things done, i.e. being effective.</p>\n\n<p>When asked “how are you?,” how often do many of us respond, with a bedraggled, hassled air, “Busy, so busy!” Our culture and our ever-connected, high-speed times have made ‘being busy’ one of the highest valued currencies in our social market. We use it to pad our egos- saying “I’m busy” is a proxy for saying “I’m important”, “I’m a valuable person” and “I’m living a full, engaged life.” And being or even just seeming, busy is considered a valid excuse for almost any of life’s demands. It’s considered a justification for not actually listening, not speaking genuinely, being late, being inconsiderate, and, perhaps most ironically, for not actually getting much done.

And there is an even bigger difference between being busy and getting things done, i.e. being effective.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eventsineveryoccasion.com/inspirations/\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/less-is-more-busyness-vs--effectiveness/assets/c.png' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-28 at 2.01.06 PM.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When asked “how are you?,” how often do many of us respond, with a bedraggled, hassled air, “Busy, so busy!” Our culture and our ever-connected, high-speed times have made ‘being busy’ one of the highest valued currencies in our social market. We use it to pad our egos- saying “I’m busy” is a proxy for saying “I’m important”, “I’m a valuable person” and “I’m living a full, engaged life.” And being, or even just seeming, busy is considered a valid excuse for almost any of life’s demands.</p>\n\n<p>It’s considered a justification for not actually listening, not speaking genuinely, being late, being inconsiderate, and, perhaps most ironically, for not actually getting much done. Being “busy” is an excuse to ourselves and others for not doing the important things, the scary things, the difficult things.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/\">Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are lots of reasons why so many of us feel so busy all the time, though. We don’t get a lot of support to breathe some space into our busy-ness and find a more effective approach. Some of the main culprits that get in the way are: interruption, distraction,  lack of clear priorities, and attachment to the idea of being busy. Interruption and distraction run so rampant that apparently the average IT worker is interrupted at the jobs as often once every 3 minutes- up to 20 times an hour. The <a href=\"https://www.yast.com/time_management/science-task-interruption-time-management/\">same study</a> shows that 3/4 of all interruptions are handled immediately, whether they need to be or not. We are on a roll, filling every last moment with tasks, regardless of whether those tasks get us closer to our bigger goals. We are too busy (or lazy or intimidated) to prioritize and so we may not actually ever be getting anything important done. <strong>We are too busy to be effective.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The trick is, simultaneously, both the simplest and the most difficult hack there is: pausing our busy lives. Being effective means being <strong>deliberate</strong>, and\nin order to be deliberate we have to pause. We have to create a gap in the steady stream, <strong>we have to create openings for space to integrate and infiltrate our lives</strong>. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, the more we look up, go for a walk, and find other ways to create space in our hectic schedules and cluttered minds, the more we can accomplish. For example, <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201304/issie-lapowsky/get-more-done-dont-multitask.html\">brain-science is now showing</a> that the more we try to multi-task, the less productive we are.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of tools in the box for breathing this kind of accomplishing space into our lives. And in our organizations we can support effectiveness through baking that space into our company cultures and systems.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/less-is-more-busyness-vs--effectiveness/assets/d.png' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-28 at 2.56.35 PM.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/less-is-more-busyness-vs--effectiveness/assets/e.png' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-28 at 2.56.59 PM.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The more we are able to be deliberate about how we spend our time and energy, the less likely we’ll be to get bogged down in trivial tasks, and the more likely we’ll be to build successful, meaningful businesses and live accomplishing, engaged lives. The lineage of Zen meditators seem to have figured it out a while ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“You should sit in meditation for twenty minutes every day — unless you’re too busy. Then you should sit for an hour.” -Zen proverb</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sub>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/blog/announcing-b-lab-colorado\">B Lab Colorado</a> for the opportunity to offer this material as a workshop at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1579907255613452.1073741847.1519708461633332&amp;type=1\">B Corp Leadership Development Event</a>.<sub></sub></sub></p>\n\n</div>\n",

For sure, it’s been there every year, but this year it was really on the proverbial sleeve. Some people will say that of course this Startup Week has includes events like “<a href=\"https://boulderstartupweek2015.sched.org/event/1001fd4cbb532f5eaabf40a572925ba2#.VVI21dpVikp\">Intro to Mindfulness for Startups</a>”, “<a href=\"https://boulderstartupweek2015.sched.org/event/e7dd8141f1a1f0097a626e9d54d91116#.VVI3FdpViko\">Finding Balance: health within the startup community</a>” and yoga sessions- it’s Boulder! That cliche might indeed hold water but, regardless, this year’s Boulder Startup Week felt not just heart-felt and holistic, but almost radically so. The most energetic conversations are not about how to make it as big as possible, as fast as possible- they were about finding <a href=\"https://boulderstartupweek2015.sched.org/event/e7dd8141f1a1f0097a626e9d54d91116#.VVJV8NpViko\">balance</a>, <a href=\"https://boulderstartupweek2015.sched.org/event/3798238c32e7e3c311d87f29038299c5#.VVJWMdpViko\">radical self-inquiry</a>, and <a href=\"https://boulderstartupweek2015.sched.org/event/286ef4fd0cd3e5c1bc6acfcabced36fc#.VVJWg9pViko\">using business as a force for good</a>. This humanistic approach to the demands and potentials of startup life is the real vanguard of the startup world. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bldrstartupweek/status/598239129957109761\">this most radical of views</a> holds that compassion and generosity can infuse the way we treat ourselves and, in turn, will be magnified through the way we run our businesses and the outcomes our businesses achieve.</p>\n\n<p>This came up in conversation with <a href=\"http://www.newdream.org/results/making-responsible-business-a-reality-interview-with-matt-stinchcomb\">Matt Stinchcomb</a>, until very recently the <a href=\"http://magazine.good.is/articles/figures-of-progress-matthew-stinchcomb-vp-of-values-and-impact-etsy\">VP of Values &amp; Impact at Etsy</a>. The reason he’s out of his VP job is because since the company went public in April (and <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jeremy-quittner/etsy-ipo-brings-b-corps-the-forefront.html\">became one of the biggest B Corps to make a public offering</a>), he is transitioning out of <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/\">etsy.com</a> and into heading up etsy.org (so new, there isn’t even a site up yet). In addition to sharing his story about the importance of garnering employee engagement in the process of certifying as a B Corp, he shared his vision for this fledgling Etsy Foundation of supporting “regenerative entrepreneurship.” The foundation will be supporting entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs-to-be in accessing education from the point of view that our entrepreneurial endeavors can actually regenerate ourselves, the environment and the economy. Regenerative entrepreneurship is personally, environmentally and socially net positive rather than being at the expense of each of these. A radical, and truly viable, vision.</p>\n\n<p>That conversation happened at a full-house event hosted by dojo4 called “B a Better Business: the B Corp Path to Best Kind of Fame, Wealth &amp; Influence.” I co-presented with Matt, <a href=\"https://www.rallydev.com/blog/authors/ryan-martens\">Ryan Martens</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sethlevine.com/\">Seth Levine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGHzqmnGH4A\">Kim Coupounas</a> on how B Corps are leading in the marketplace, attracting capital and magnetizing a driven, engaged workforce. We talked about how all sizes of companies can foster regenerative, generous and robust business models. We’re learning and showing, at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BSW15&amp;src=tyah\">Boulder Startup Week</a> and beyond, that we can create personal, environmental and social wealth with our startups. And we’re having a great time and looking spectacular while doing it!</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-new-startups-got-heart/assets/c.png' alt=\"dogooders.png\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-new-startups-got-heart/assets/d.png' alt=\"BCorp.png\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><em>We were fortunate to be visited recently by Cassie Gardner from <a href=\"http://www.youth-roots.org/\">YouthRoots</a>. We were happy and proud to be able to donate to her organization and asked her to write a blog post about what <a href=\"http://www.youth-roots.org/\">YouthRoots</a> does and how you, too, can help them do it….</em>\n<strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong>_____</p>\n\n<p>Hi, my name is Cassie and I am a YouthBoard member of <a href=\"http://www.youth-roots.org/\">YouthRoots</a>. I know what you’re thinking, and no—I am not a member of a religious youth group and I am not about to tell you why you need religion.</p>\n\n<p>Now that that is cleared up (I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to clarify what YouthRoots is), I can explain what YouthRoots actually is and why you are seeing it on Dojo4’s website is without any misconceptions or distractions.</p>\n\n<p>In short, YouthRoots is youth-led philanthropy which empowers teenagers to change the world, literally. YouthRoots acts as a philanthropic vessel which allows teenagers (sophomores, juniors, and seniors in high school) such as myself to engage in community partnership, personal development, new mediums for humanitarian leadership, and social action.</p>\n\n<p><em>So how does it work?</em></p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the school year in June, a bunch of random kids from northern Denver who were accepted into YouthRoots got together, assembled a YouthBoard, and created a needs assessment of the northern Denver area—basically figuring out what at-risk youth in Northern Denver suffer from most. From here we, identified poverty as the main boundary preventing social mobility in young adults from the North Denver-Metro area.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/youthroots-and-how-it-can-matter-to-you-too/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"YR1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We asked ourselves: What is the best way to combat youth poverty?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After extensive research, we identified after-school enrichment programs offered by non-profits such as the Maria Droste Counseling Center, <a href=\"http://youthforachange.org/\">Colorado Youth for a Change</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.ihaveadreamfoundation.org/\">I Have a Dream Foundation</a> are the best way to encourage social mobility in youth and break fiscal boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>Next came fundraising for these non-profits who apply for grants with YouthRoots. Here is where dojo4 comes in. dojo4 was assigned to me as one of three businesses which I would give a “pitch” to where I explain what YouthRoots is about, why it matters, what is going on with the youth in Denver, which non-profits help combat these regional issues, and ask whether or not they are interested in helping fundraise for these non-profits.</p>\n\n<p>Over some awesome peppermint tea with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ara.t.howard\">Ara Howard</a>, the <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard\">CTO of dojo4</a>, dojo4 agreed to invest in Colorado Youth. Basically, dojo4 agreed to donate to YouthRoots so we could put 100% of their investment toward some of the non-profit grants which YouthRoots received (including the Maria Droste Counseling Center, Colorado Youth for a Change, and the I Have a Dream Foundation).</p>\n\n<p>Why does this matter? On a grand scale, it’s amazing. As a part of a YouthBoard composed of about 13 kids from northern Denver, we raised $10,000 this year to give back to non-profits which solve for issues facing Denver youth.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is huge— the non-profits we are supporting this year (which I have mentioned) change lives, and couldn’t do it without the help of organizations like YouthRoots, and philanthropic businesses such as dojo4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Personally, on a smaller scale, this gives me hope and inspiration to create a better future. YouthRoots was not my first volunteering endeavor. I’ve always volunteered in my life, whether that was helping at a community run, taking on a summer volunteering responsibility at a shelter, or helping at a hospital. Volunteering has always been fun and rewarding, but truthfully I never saw the benefits which my volunteering created. As a result, even though I liked volunteering, I wasn’t passionate about it. This was before YouthRoots. Now, post-YouthRoots, I see volunteering as the absolute best way to make a difference in this world and create a future which I want to live in and be a part of.</p>\n\n<p>YouthRoots has empowered me to realize that if I seek change in the world, then I have the ability and even obligation to create that change. YouthRoots has shown be that being “just a 17 year-old girl” doesn’t cut it anymore as an excuse to avoid trying to better my community. YouthRoots has permanently (and for the better) changed my perspective on how the world works and why it is the way it is.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By connecting teenagers to businesses such as dojo4, which are interested in fostering a better future, it forces us to recognize that change is possible— it just takes a little time and effort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>If you are interested in being involved in YouthRoots, learning more about the organization, or would like to contribute to the cause, the YouthRoots website contains all of that information: <a href=\"http://www.youth-roots.org/\">http://www.youth-roots.org</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/youthroots-and-how-it-can-matter-to-you-too/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"YR3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

Although there have been <a href=\"http://emailadore.com/emails/5568c83d42937dec6b000003\">outpourings of support</a>, <a href=\"http://www.humanosphere.org/world-politics/2015/05/post-quake-funds-for-nepal-drying-up/\">only a fraction of the the UN appeal for funds has been met and those monies are now only trickling in as monsoon season approaches</a> and the reality of landslides and flooding threatens with further infrastructure damage, disease and loss of life.

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>The problem with volunteerism is that it doesn’t really work. Not over the long haul - and if you really care about impact, then you’d better be in it for the long haul. The simple truth is: <em>whenever we ask for work to be done for free, we diminish its inherent value.</em></p>\n\n<p>Before you disagree, let me clarify that I’m not talking about the kind of volunteer opportunities that were <em>made</em> for volunteers - like <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others\">natural disaster response</a>, Rylan’s <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/dojo4-ninja-rescues-boulders-food\">weekly gig with Boulder Food Rescue</a>, or B Lab Colorado’s recent <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bcorpcolorado/timeline/story?ut=43&amp;wstart=0&amp;wend=1435733999&amp;hash=2972421971526564280&amp;pagefilter=3\">#BofService day</a>. These types of mutually enriching engagements are AWESOME win-wins, of course.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-problem-with-volunteerism/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"6-3-76_volunteer-color.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>There are many other time-tested organizational models that create volunteer opportunities as part of their mission. For example: missions.  I’m also not talking about when people volunteer for their own startup - that’s sweat equity (or just your own special brand of crazy, depending on who you ask).</p>\n\n<p>What I am talking about is trying to get people to do for free what they would (and should) otherwise get paid to do. Sometimes it’s called working pro bono, often it’s called activism.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning of most worthy endeavors, a few core people arrange their entire lives to work mostly for free at least until “we get it off the ground.” What is accomplished in these initial sprints is often amazing, but it’s not sustainable.</p>\n\n<p>No one has examined the dilemma created by working our hearts out for free better than my friend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_F._Barry\">Jane Barry</a>, in her groundbreaking book on <a href=\"http://urgentactionfund.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/06/WTPR-Final-Book.pdf\">sustaining activism</a>.  See if this sounds familiar:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*\"At first, you use your own home as an office. You work every spare hour you can to organise, often after your ‘day job’ is finished and everyone else is in bed. Slowly, other activists join you. Usually, for little or no pay...And when you do find a way to bring in outside support and funding, you are so driven and passionate about getting the real work done, at first, you only ask for money to do more...*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>This kind of organising is amazing. It is enormously powerful, flexible, responsive, grounded in real\nissues, and deeply connected to community. For many, it is also the beginning of a cycle that will eventually threaten their ability to work safely and sustainably.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>*Because you have built everything yourself, those enormous contributions of time, energy, and resources — the true price of your work — are hidden. Since the real costs of activism aren’t factored into initial requests for support, it creates an artificial impression that an extraordinary amount of work can be accomplished with tiny amounts of money. It makes activism a bargain.*\n\n*Everyone loves a bargain. That sharp, sweet sense of satisfaction at finding something you really want, and getting it at a fraction of its real value. But here’s the thing: When you keep finding bargains, they start to lose that special something. That sense of value...* \n\n*And that’s a big problem with activism. We set the bar too low...It comes down, once again, to what we truly value. What we recognise as important.\"*\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, before you “find a volunteer to do that,” consider that you might be better off in the long run using the resources it will take to recruit, train, supervise and retain volunteer(s) in fundraising for a paid position. Have the vision to think long-term, and build a foundation for your efforts that will <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/so-you-want-to-change-the-world-we-do-too-by-building-better-businesses-aka-the-little-handbook-for-sturdy-startups\">sustain the people who are core to its success</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you do decide that volunteers are going to be an important part of your organization, train yourself to be (or hire) a kick-ass - and I mean <em>take-no-prisoners</em> - volunteer manager.  <a href=\"http://www.idealist.org/info/VolunteerMgmt/Developing\">Create solid policies and use contracts</a> with your volunteers to ensure total alignment of expectations.  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellindenmayer/2012/10/15/fire-dangerous-volunteers-rid-your-charity-of-vampires-and-zombies/\">Fire volunteers</a> who don’t follow through and find ways to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellindenmayer/2013/06/03/7-traits-of-amazing-volunteers/\">worship those who do</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And, if you’re a professional who is considering volunteering your services, make sure you fit these three criteria first:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>You have <em>extra</em> time that’s truly <em>extra</em> - beyond what you need to make a living, spend time with friends and family and take care of yourself.</li>\n  <li>You’re financially secure, meaning you won’t ditch your volunteer gig to take on paying work when it comes along.</li>\n  <li>You’re truly compatible with the organization you’ll be working with - both its mission and its team members.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I’ve contemplated these dynamics for years from many angles - as the volunteer, as the volunteer manager, as the funder looking for a bargain.</p>\n\n<p>It’s fascinating to now look at this issue from within a technology organization.  Most people, including myself, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/\">don’t really understand tech</a>, and this contributes to not really valuing it.</p>\n\n<p>From what I’ve seen so far with both non-profit and for-profit clients: success is cheaper in the end if you prioritize paying for really high quality people and solid tech from a reliable firm, establishing long-term relationships to support the co-evolution of both.</p>\n\n<p>You get what you pay for, folks.  On that note, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/contact\">drop me a line</a> - I’m happy to help you explain to your funders and investors why you don’t want to skimp on good people or good tech!</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><img src='/ro/dojo4/hacking-human-suffering-is-the-only-real-growth-industry/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"AllanDeas.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>When I first became a partner at DOJO4 in 2011, things were rocking steady, decent clients were finding us with little or no effort on our part, and a general sense of creamy, rich ease pervaded the business. Nevertheless, our then CEO, <a href=\"http://hoosteeno.com/\">Justin Crawford</a>, and I spoke often about the longevity of the industry and the fact that DOJO4’s success was tied to the bubble-like nature of the tech industry.</p>\n\n<p>We talked a lot about business development and how to best insulate ourselves in the long term against an eventual downturn. At the time,  I could not foresee the tech “bubble” bursting any time soon, but the answer to where we should be putting our energy for long-term stability and success was crystal clear to me from the get go: human suffering.</p>\n\n<p>That’s right.  The painful truth is that solving the problems of human and environmental dis-ease is one of the only guaranteed growth industries. That may sound like a dismal pronouncement, but I also see it as the greatest opportunity of our time.  At DOJO4- and many, many other tech businesses- we have all the circumstances in place to apply our skills, talents, and ingenuity to solving real problems,  using the same technical and design innovations that we had been applying mostly just to commercial endeavors.</p>\n\n<p>Making that shift would allow us to engage our work in a genuinely meaningful way, and allow us to have a sustainable, impactful business at the same time. This line of thinking can run somewhat counter to conventional business-school wisdom. <em>Make money and help people at the same time? No way. Helping people and the environment is the domain of NGO’s, non-profits and philanthropies.</em></p>\n\n<p>This reaction is an unfortunate outcome of our cultural approach to altruism. Donating our time and money for the benefit of others can be a wonderful thing but it is not the only, and maybe <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/the-problem-with-volunteerism\">not even the best</a>, way to galvanize our best efforts for the benefit of ailing social and environmental systems. The relatively recent rise of social entrepreneurship has exposed this approach and solution- using the power of business to provide <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/social_entrepreneur\">innovative solutions to society’s most pressing social problems, tackling major social and environmental issues, and offering new ideas for wide-scale change. Rather than leaving societal needs to the government or business sectors, social entrepreneurs find what is not working and solve the problem by changing the system, selling the solution, and persuading entire societies to move in different directions.</a></p>\n\n<p>At their best this is what technologists can do, too:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…<a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/social_entrepreneur\">solve the problem by changing the system, spreading the solution, and persuading entire societies to move in different directions</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With my outsider’s perspective on the tech industry (I was educated as a scientist and have spent most of my career in documentary film), I continue to marvel at the fact that the most inspired technologists have essentially the same <a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/blog/6-characteristics-of-successful-social-entrepreneurs/\">qualities as social entrepreneurs,  (such as the willingness to self-correct, share credit, and break free of established structures)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Jj2ObZI9M\">we’ve squandered a lot of our developer smarts and talent</a> on creating commercially self-fulfilling junk food for the mind and an intricate digital economy stickily entwined with proprietary software, profits and data appropriation. Many technologists feel like they are stuck with that as their only option. But, if you really want a better world, a successful career and a more meaningful life, writing code that directly alleviates human and environmental suffering is a real option and living, breathing opportunity.</p>\n\n<p><em>It is possible</em>. Several years after those initial conversations at DOJO4, we’ve committed to that triple bottom line of people, planet and profits. We see that the alleviation of human, social and environmental suffering is the best use of our energy because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>this ‘sector’ has essentially endless needs, and is thus a fertile, demand-full market;</li>\n  <li>it draws on the best qualities of developers innate approach to problem-solving and knowledge-building;</li>\n  <li>it allows us to feel more engaged in a meaningful life, and that means we do better work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So far, acknowledging that solving ‘real’ human and environmental problems is a valuable growth industry, and choosing to put all our eggs in that basket, is the best business decision we’ve ever made.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/hacking-human-suffering-is-the-only-real-growth-industry/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"ProcessedWorld01.3_36.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Illustrations without permission but thanks to <a href=\"http://www.allandeas.com/\">Allan Deas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/world-processor\">Processed World</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

It wasn’t so long ago that technology represented hope; that it represented power; and, most of all, that it represented change.  Our hacker culture has settled, and it now accepts meaningless goals, meaningless rewards, and meaningless lives.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>We are living at the precise moment when, for the first time in history, the planet is connected at a practical and personal level via a network of hyper-intelligent software and hyper-intelligent hardware.  We live our lives during the very moment at which individuals possess the greatest power to affect change that they have ever held in the history of mankind.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A tipping point may already have been reached. Like the printing press, the radio, and the television before it,  the makers of the internet may have already given away the deep knowledge to those that seek only the consolidation of wealth and control.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>But, it may not be too late. The massive proliferation of knowledge and the flattening of understanding presents a unique opportunity for those of us currently piloting the spaceships: we can choose to continue patrolling the planet and maintaining the status quo, or we can choose to look over our shoulders - to the left - at a that glimmering light in the distance, and set a new course.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH YOU SHOULD CAFFEINATE AND READ THE (EDITED) TRANSCRIPT BELOW.</strong></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-23 at 5.13.09 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>My name’s Ara T.

It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s all for social good, or that it doesn’t make money, but it’s just trying to level the playing field for all people on the planet - very broad definition.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been in the Ruby community for a very long time – since before Ruby 1.4 – long before Rails - and I’ve seen Ruby go through some profound changes. One of these changes is how the development community at large, and Ruby in particular, has become a little bit more small minded than they were initially.</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to encourage you to consider that a lot of the things we talk about, we obsess about, we think about may actually be the <em>wrong</em> things, and really to try to remind people that programming is a super powerful thing and that everyone in this room actually has a big responsibility to do something with that power.</p>\n\n<p>I want to start out by asking – a show of hands – how many people think the world economy would not collapse in three days if every software developer in the world stopped going to work?  No hands.  So, this is what I’m talking about and yet, most of us aren’t working on changing the world for the better.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-23 at 4.50.52 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, I’ll illustrate this with a story.  I’m the guy in the middle – always the Linux guy. I’m going to start out with Ruby Conf. 2006, which was in Denver.  At this Ruby conference I was still on a Linux lap top and what I witnessed was, in retrospect, a little bit of the beginning of the end. At that time I never had a Windows machine. I came from the Linux hacking community where there was really a deep belief at that time that through open source and through software we could actually change the world.  Right?  Code had power. There was this deep, revolutionary belief in what we were doing.</p>\n\n<p>And this, I believe, was the moment when that began to change in a majority of developers minds.  I think this guy on the left is the problem. I have one of these now.  But I remember sitting there at Ruby Conf. and this guy had a Mac. It was the first Macbook. DHH was speaking at this Ruby Conf., and I remember it was like the first time where Ruby programming had this aura of being cool. It wasn’t just about making computer programs, it was not just about trying to change the world through open source, or being nice, or any of those things. It was also cool for the first time. And I remember thinking to myself, “Man, I fucking want one of those computers.”</p>\n\n<p>So, at the time I was working for a research faculty at The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Earth Sciences. I was helping to build what was the largest super computers in the world at that time (for five days or something until it was eclipsed). And after that I was doing some really cool Ruby work – also super computing work and big data - truly big data, as in Petabytes of data - visualizations and analysis with Ruby, which was kind of groundbreaking at the time.</p>\n\n<p>The data came from a set of polar-orbiting satellites, which produce the only remotely-sensed data set that measures man. These DMSP satellites continuously collect data all over the world and it’s used for real-time tactical air decisions by the U.S. Air Force. It has the cool property, however, that on the backside of the world – the dark side – they just chuck that data.</p>\n\n<p>My group was the official archive for this data, so we got a ton of money for doing some stuff I still don’t feel that great about. But what we did on the side was a little bit of a Robin Hood play, where we would take the discarded information and we would do things like be able to measure the extent of the storms after Hurricane Katrina for the White House. We would do things like measure the location of refugee camps in the Saharan desert so that food drops could go in but not reveal the location of those refugee camps to the opposing side so that they could be bombed. Or we would measure the total CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by gas flares, which by the way, is actually equivalent to like all the gasoline burned in cars per day. So, we felt kind of good about that and I felt like I was making a positive contribution - robbing from Peter to pay Paul, but it was a fun time.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/d.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-24 at 3.16.37 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>But there was that fucking Mac laptop.  I think by the time Ruby Conf. 2007 rolled around, it was really just about these two guys, right?  Steve Jobs &amp; Bill Gates and no one was really thinking about Linux in the Ruby community anymore, or really that sort of zeitgeist. We were hooked.</p>\n\n<p>About this time I was contacted by what now is known to be a startup that was acquired by Oracle to compile the Gnu scientific library so that it would run in the Ruby one-click installer. And that was where I took the bait, basically. I quit my job and I started contracting. It was really cool. Looking back now realize that I was helping to build many of the startups that have been acquired in Boulder ever since. I was part of the machine.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/e.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-23 at 4.51.19 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, yeah, I was drinking the Kool-aid. I was fully hooked and engaged in doing something that I now question with some suspicion. I made a lot of money, met a lot of people, super fun. I was able to start a company - DOJO4. We live in a fantastic place.  Boulder’s amazing.  We have super cool people.  We enjoy what we do.  It’s kind of cake, right?  So it seems like everything should be good…</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/f.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-24 at 3.55.11 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>But I started getting this nagging sensation that I wasn’t really compelled by the work that I was doing. I started at night laying there thinking, “Man, do I really have to fucking build that same user system again, that same voting system or that same feature that every startup has?” Everything started seeming very much the same. It started feeling very incestuous and without purpose.</p>\n\n<p>So we started having these discussions internally in the company, beginning of last year. Everything’s great but why are we doing this? Is it worth it? Should we do something else?  And software’s hard, so these are important questions to ask. It’s not like it’s an easy job or a stress-free job. We started really wanting more.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/g.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-23 at 4.51.36 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, this guy was also in the back of my mind at the time.  How many people know who this is? [Hands go up] That’s fantastic. I gave this talk in a room of 300 people two weeks ago in Denver and I asked that same question and zero people raised their hands. It was shocking to me.</p>\n\n<p>This is Richard Stahlman, and when I was a Linux hacker he wrote a lot of Manifestos. He’s a crazy motherfucker, for all intents and purposes.  At the time he seemed genuinely crazy - he was talking about things like why open source software is important for things like privacy and why it could be a force to fight against government surveillance of your communications, just as an example.  Everyone thought he was crazy.</p>\n\n<p>So, this spider sense was ringing in my ear. If you go back and read some of the things he was saying, what you will discover is it was all fucking right. Every single thing was right. He may have not been the best messenger - it wasn’t candy-coated, perhaps it wasn’t sexy enough, it didn’t come wrapped with a little Apple icon on it, it wasn’t aluminum and there was no stock options. However, everything he said was right, and I think people have forgotten it. No one talks about freedom anymore in software.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we know now that simple decisions like the ones people in this room make such as contributing to open source software so that we have cryptography libraries that aren’t controlled by governments or corporations are kind of important - <em>incredibly</em> important, actually, and affect millions of lives.</p>\n\n<p>So these things are rumbling around in my head – Stahlman, what the fuck are we doing?  What are we making?  Same thing over and over. Then I got invited to a conference that was hosted by <a href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/\">The Unreasonable Institute</a>. Now, they don’t have anything to do with software. They’re an accelerator, an incubator. They’re the one whose definition of impact I co-opted: A world where no one is limited by their circumstance. Their whole mission is to facilitate that revolution, and their whole belief is that governments can’t do it, NGOs can’t do it - only businesses can do it.</p>\n\n<p>So this is not about charities, it’s not about legislation. The idea is that business can solve the world’s problems. I think a lot of times in software we think about a very bifurcated concept between donating our time to open source, to work for free for charities, to have hackfests to help our cities; and then we work to make money doing shit that a lot of us might not care about that much. So using business as a force for good is a really new idea and it took a long time for me to actually accept it.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/h.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-25 at 9.39.45 AM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, I was a technical mentor at this two-week <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/girl-effect-accelerator-braindump\">Girl Effect Accelerator</a>.  We worked seventeen hours a day.  It was insane.  We were working with 10 companies that were selected because their product directly had a positive impact on adolescent women. I won’t go into the details of why that was, but I will tell you that none of the companies were doing anything that you think that they might be doing.</p>\n\n<p>For example one of them is <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/work/Paga\">a banking application</a> – mobile banking. What the fuck does that have to do with adolescent women? Well, if you happen to be building that application in a country where 85% of the population has no access to banking, and the primary way of moving cash is to give kid the money and have them get on a bus – that happens to be a pretty dangerous job. Then you’re having an impact on women.</p>\n\n<p>Or, you <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/work/off-grid-electric\">make solar lights</a>.  How does that impact adolescent women?  Because in the countries that this company is operating in, women have less opportunity to do homework, they’re expected to do the cleaning and cooking, and by the time they would have an opportunity to do their homework it’s dark. They have no electricity so they can’t do their homework.</p>\n\n<p>I thought, hey that’s neat; it’s great that they’re doing that. But then some other things started creeping in.  Like, in two weeks working with ten startups no one said the word “exit” once. All the companies that we were working with – and these are companies that are operating in a place where the average consumer makes less than $2 per day. Poor countries. All these companies have profit revenues of 2.5 million or higher, so respectively they’re fucking killing it.</p>\n\n<p>All the companies were bootstrapped and on a smooth revenue curve. No one was like, “We’re gonna take a bunch of cash, we’re gonna make up a problem, we’re gonna solve it and then as soon as we can just figure out the business model to do with this billions of dollars of software and data, we’re gonna be rich!”  These folks didn’t take the money. They were selling their product out of the gate. Huge, huge technical innovations, right?</p>\n\n<p>And the barriers that these companies face are things like: I’m selling a light but nobody has enough money and no way to pay me. So, in addition to making a light, I have to design a micro-finance company, I have to build an app that runs on feature phones (remember the little LCD screens before smart phones?) <em>and</em> smart phones, so that people can pay me in little bits. Oh shit, the local currency doesn’t work so I actually have to figure out how to do it with bitcoin and other ways of arbitrage so it can go across countries. So, every company had significant problems that we don’t have - like I can pay anybody here with a phone or cash, I can communicate with you, you have light - and <em>they were solving a lot of these problems through technology.</em></p>\n\n<p>This is possible because just in the last few years essentially you have an entire continent – and this is true elsewhere, Africa is just an example of this – where you have a shit-ton of problems, and everybody now has the Internet in their pocket. Right? And a Javascript engine.</p>\n\n<p>So, this is a profoundly important time where if you write a piece of software, you have the ability to impact the entire world on this [holds up a phone]. That didn’t exist before right now. The tipping point’s here, today, right? With mobile phone ownership the opportunity is immense.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/program-like-you-give-a-damn/assets/i.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-25 at 9.49.35 AM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So, what I realized after digesting all this and working with all these companies was: whoa, this is actually working. They’re making money. They’re doing something that doesn’t suck. They’re doing incredibly cool technology. The engineering team is having fun. I mean, these are real challenges, right?</p>\n\n<p>So, super interesting problem and ability to make an impact. And then I finally understood and developed a new definition of the word impact: if you have a fucking problem and I solve it, you buy it from me. You don’t need marketing for this. Some people just call this good business.</p>\n\n<p>So, I think the thing that’s wrong with a whole lot of the startup community - and the development community by side effect – is that people have forgotten that the fundamental criteria for having a successful business and engineering a solution is having a real problem. Right?  You actually need a problem to solve in order to write code that has an impact. And the whole point of this talk, again, is just to encourage the people on the ground – you, the troops – that this is possible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://unreasonable.is/hacking-human-suffering-real-growth-industry/\">There are plenty of real problems</a>. We don’t have to be solving non-problems with one of the most powerful tools on the planet - code. So, why are we solving non-problems with it? To make people more money? Of course we want to make <em>enough</em> money, but we’re not smart enough make another choice or have an positive impact through our life’s work?</p>\n\n<p>So, what my company did when I came back from that is we talked about it for quite awhile and then we fired everybody. Absolutely everybody. It wasn’t as harsh as it sounds. I actually talk with all our engineers, all our designers and all of our contractors and I said, “We’re tired of building stupid shit.” The sentiment when I started talking with everybody was that we all want to do something meaningful. Every single person said some permutation of, “That sounds great, because I’m tired of building stupid shit, too.”</p>\n\n<p>So, we made some fundamental changes to our business model. Almost all the people that we fired are back in different capacities. We have a different organization now, but we jumped with both feet.</p>\n\n<p>We also <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/5-benefits-to-becoming-a-b-corp\">became a B Corp</a>, which is fundamentally the equivalent of fair trade coffee or organic certification for food. There are 1,300 B Corporations in the world that are basically committed to business transparency, having a social impact. It’s about making money, but it’s also a commitment to making a positive impact on the world – socially, environmentally, etc. So,  we’re still a software agency, and now have companies calling us up out of the blue saying, “You’re a B Corp, we’re a B Corp, we’re trying to solve this problem together.”</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of unknowns, we don’t know where it’s going to go long-term, but we’re all sleeping a lot better.  We feel better about the work that we’re doing – still software, we’re still like fucking debugging javascript in IE. I mean, it’s the same job but something’s fundamentally different, and that’s real nice.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I’m trying to engage people to think about is to come along on this journey with me. Think about what you’re doing and how you can do something a little bit better with the power that you have.</p>\n\n<p>So, this may seem like a little bit high-level, un-actionable, abstract for somebody who’s going to go to work tomorrow morning at 9:00am. So, I just want to give three concepts for how you might start putting this into practice; and to encourage you to believe that it may actually have a bigger impact than you would think.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing is just to position yourself to actually find real problems. So, does that mean quitting your job and like going to India or something? That’s not what I mean, actually. I think very few of us don’t have real problems within a two-mile radius of where we work or where we live. Does it mean working for charity, volunteering your time? It might.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that we do at DOJO4 is we’re on the Board of <a href=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org/\">Awesome Boulder</a>, which gives $1,000 a month to things that are 1) Awesome and 2) In Boulder.\n Sometimes they resemble charities, sometimes they resemble public art projects, but one of the things that’s really interesting about that from a software perspective is that just by being engaged in that I see a lot of things that I don’t see otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>So, I think the value in getting engaged in some sort of volunteer work or charity is not just what you’re doing with your time, it’s that somebody will show you what the real problems for free. They’ll just tell you what the problem is. You don’t even have to be that creative. Oh, and by the way, you know how to use computers, so take the solution they’re working on and where they could turn it up to 2, you can turn it up to 2,000. Right? That’s the power that you have with computing.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to find problems is to look at what’s painful for you, right? Like, what do you hate? I was saying earlier that I’ve written 100, 200 gems, something like that. One of my most popular gems of all time was a gem called <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/gems/rubyforge/versions/2.0.4\">rubyforge</a>. This was before Ruby gems existed and it was the only way you could publish shit. It was so awful. You had to click all these buttons, and at some point I was like, really? I have to do this every time just to give somebody my code? So I automated it. I built a robot. I think it’s still my most popular gem of all time. I just looked at something that sucked for me, and I fixed it. If you hate doing something you can be guaranteed that a lot of other developers also hate doing it, too, so fix it and then move on to doing something bigger with your time. You’re having an impact, you’re letting somebody focus on something better than what they were focusing on before.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to find real problems is to look at your group’s pain. In other words, looking at the opportunity in your work for being a little more human. Like, it’s actually hard to present something you’re unsure of, especially in a group of engineers who are always right.  It’s maybe not that comfortable, right?  Maybe you can have an impact there just in yoru cultural practices in the office. And you can extend that to your company and the users of your product.  You can start to think about what’s painful for them and maybe taking the initiative, proposing something.</p>\n\n<p>Number two is to position yourself to understand people.  This is a big topic, but I think it’s really interesting.  How many people here when they went to computer science school officially or unofficially were trained in psychology? I think this is interesting point because as engineers we all are told that the first step to solving a problem is understanding it, right? Ironically, the way that you understand a problem is by talking to people.  Step 1. And it’s something that engineers have zero training in.</p>\n\n<p>How do they know they’re solving a real problem if they can’t unpack it? We all know this, right?  Like, business people are really bad at saying what their problem really is, but we have a responsibility to be better at trying to get at what they’re saying.  Why are they saying it?</p>\n\n<p>Two other quick points on positioning yourself to understand people. 1) I recommend looking for opportunities to break things. We use our intellect a lot, our technical skill. But look for opportunities to break your mind, think in new ways. I’ll make two specific recommendations. I recommend that you read <em><a href=\"http://www.shambhala.com/what-makes-you-not-a-buddhist.html\">What Makes You Not a Buddhist</a></em> - because it’s a fascinating look at how our minds work, not because you may be interested in being a Buddhist.</p>\n\n<p>I also recommend that you look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems\">Gödel’s theory of incompleteness</a>, which is foundational to computer science. I am going to also lead you down a rabbit hole of questioning the things that we build our assumptions on as engineers — namely that mathematics engineering can be complete and correct at the same time. You have give up on one of them, which is a pretty uncomforatlbe place to be for most engineers who think ultimately we’ll get there, one small step at a time. But, nothing like that is actually possible.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I would say is just to again invite you to commit yourself to solving real problems. Look for opportunities - ways you can do that internally, inside your company, inside your communities and bigger. I’ll close with a little anecdote to illustrate that we’re still doing the same work, but with a different impact.</p>\n\n<p>In Boulder we had some huge floods in 2013, and <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others\">DOJO4 pitched in to help folks rebuild</a>. There were a lot of work parties to shovel shit and mud out of people’s basements. And if I asked one of you folks here, “Hey, do you want to come over to my house and shovel shit?  Write java, say?”  You would say, “Definitely not.”  If I said, “Hey, you’re my friend, my house just got flooded. Will you come over with a bunch of us, listen to music, eat pizza, drink beer and shovel shit?” Then you’d say, “Hey, I’m there! I’ll help you out.”</p>\n\n<p>So, the <em>reason</em> that you’re doing the work matters a great deal. Real impact does start with simple acts of fundamentally being kind. Matz is the greatest example. Look at how small of a thing it was just to say, “Ruby is about being nice; I’m nice.” Look at how many people he impacted through just that statement. Look at the different kinds of software and conversations that are had in the Ruby community versus other communities. It’s quite possible. And that’s it.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

What are you up to Friday? Want to (speak) at a software conf for 20 min?</p>\n\n<p>Speak wasn’t in there, so I wasn’t a 100% sure what he wanted me to do at a software conf, but I messaged him back “what time?” and my phone number.</p>\n\n<p>And here I am. Graham and I met over a weekend at the CU Hack fest last spring - where I was a judge and equally unqualified as I am to speak here today.</p>\n\n<p>But you know how sometimes you meet someone and you’re like: damn he has a good vibe and is interesting. I like him. Would love to work with him sometime.</p>\n\n<p>That’s what I thought about Graham, and that’s why I’m here and hold onto that notion for the next 18 minutes and</p>\n\n<p>Why am I here and what the fuck does another straight, white, male with an ego, a microphone, a big mouth and a story, have anything to do with Rails?</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in Miami and rails had a much different meaning among my peers.</p>\n\n<p>I’m Mark Gelband and I truly know less than one or zero about Ruby on the Rails or any kind of coding. I know when I showed up at college way back when, they had classes in Basic and Fortran, and I was far more interested in poetry, partying and satisfying my basest needs on Maslow’s hierarchy - self-esteem and self-actualization didn’t matter much then.</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to try and weave together three different and very important stories - How I got here? Today? Right now?</p>\n\n<p>The course of a love relationship and why it matters?</p>\n\n<p>And how Rails, and more specifically what each of you are doing with your coding skills and lives, can transform how we all work, live and become better versions of ourselves.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/c.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_02.png\" /> \nHere goes, please be gentle, I got the call to speak 45 hours ago, and I will share more details personally if you’re interested:</p>\n\n<p>I’ve done a bunch of really cool things in my life, but I’m not sure any of them amount to anything very meaningful. It’s a fucking bummer to become 50 and still feel that. Two years ago, I got shit-canned from my safe and moderately fulfilling job. I had just got a raise and promotion 6 weeks before I got fired.</p>\n\n<p>This is a book of the first 100 pages of correspondence I made with my wife. We met online. So we wrote. This book is full of romance and represents that yearning burning feeling inside you, deep inside me. You know it. That romantic phase of any relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Audience participation: When you were 10 did you think: I want to be a coder. How many of you are in a job doing exactly what you want? How many of you are working for a company that treats you like a grown up who shows up? How many of you if left to your own devices do your best work from midnight until 3 am or 5 am to noon? How many of you are satisfied?</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/d.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_03.png\" /> \nAfter getting fired, I focused on trying to finish building my family’s home - Boulder’s first shipping container home. In some way it’s more than a home, it’s a vanity art project, in some ways a “fuck you” to the rich, white, “quality of life” “neighborhood character” pseudo-liberal BS around me. and i’m part of the problem too.</p>\n\n<p>don’t get me wrong, i know how relatively privileged I am; we all are.</p>\n\n<p>When I met my love, she lived in this crazy cool church and had it filled with amazing art and art projects and collections and clothes and shoes and stuff. Now I sometimes wonder how I can deal with all her stuff.</p>\n\n<p>“I had a lot of stuff when you met me;” it’s not like it was false advertising. From her perspective I, too, have plenty of shit - emotional and otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>But we all choose where we’re at: jobs, life, here. What happens after the illusion fades. What happens after the light in which we are seen and see disappears? you’re the best kisser, the best lover, you’re so handsome,</p>\n\n<p>you don’t care about your things, why are you wearing that sweatshirt i hate, trim your beard blah blah blah</p>\n\n<p>This happens at work too - we have a ping pong table and climbing wall, lunches three times a week, on-site laundry and chair massages, here’s 80 grand out of G school junior coder. we want you. you’re amazing. be here at 8:30, 1 hour for lunch, stay here 70 hours and meet this deadline.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/e.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_04.png\" /> \nThese are images from one of my favorite contemporary sculptors Thom Puckey. His work is provocative, controversial. Yesterday, I got challenged by a woman I respect very deeply about the two other images I had chosen.</p>\n\n<p>Puckey’s work directly questions the objectification of women and cultural norms around power, weapons, war and the body.</p>\n\n<p>The line Armed and Relatively Dangerous is the name of his latest show.</p>\n\n<p>It also has deep meaning for anyone with an intellect and the faintest notion of emotional evolution.</p>\n\n<p>My son said to me recently: “you don’t want to finish the house dad because you won’t know what to do.” He’s partially right. What I know is that I don’t want to work with people I don’t like, trust nor respect anymore doing anything that isn’t in some way helping make the world a better place for my grandchildren, your families.</p>\n\n<p>I know that’s easier said than done when there are mortgage payments, two teenagers going to college, good restaurants I want to eat at - whatever.</p>\n\n<p>In love, we begin to learn our partner in way where we can accept, communicate and grow or stick a knife deep in that place where we know the other is most vulnerable. I’d say in most relationships - both are happening at any given time.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me back to us - in this room - all of you who are holding so much damned power. My friend Ara Howard from Dojo 4 - someone much more qualified to be speaking code and coding with purpose - says “we - coders - are carrying AK47s. What we choose to do with that power is the story.”</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/f.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_05.png\" /> \nThis is a bit of a break.\nMy father is an old-time cigar smoker, and so I have at various times been fascinated by cigar culture. In Cuban cigar factories, the reader was one of the most respected positions in the factory.</p>\n\n<p>Long before sonos, podcasts and deephouse sets, the reader in the cigar factory did just that. Read to workers for their entertainment, to help make the relatively mundane somewhat more enjoyable, fulfilling.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/g.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_06.png\" /> \nGerald Locklin, one of my early writing teachers, said if you can answer yes to these three questions, you’ve probably written something worthwhile. The first question is the hardest part. Do you know?</p>\n\n<p>If you can answer yes to the first two questions, someone cares even if it’s just your grandmother.</p>\n\n<p>I want to finish building my house for myself, my family and my need to do something meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>I want to continue to work on love after romance with the most beautiful woman in the known universe. This requires me to rigorously look at my bullshit and be open to criticism and grow and change.</p>\n\n<p>I want to inspire all of you to think about what you’re doing with the power of code and how if the conditions were ripe to respect you as a person, coming to a space you want to work, an environment with employment practices that nurture your whole self, and provide meaningful work that does something positive in the world, would you be interested?</p>\n\n<p>That’s a real question. You’ve written millions of lines of code, you’re on a path of being a better person, you’re here because you want to learn something, to be a better version of yourself. Now what?</p>\n\n<p>Do you want your power to go to Drizly, so we can solve the liquor deliver problem? Or do you want to write code that helps transform our world?</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, that’s a real question?</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/h.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_07.png\" /> \nHere’s a bit more of how I got here: I made a whimsical investment in Ello because I believe in an elevated conversation and beautiful content and data privacy. I realize that creatives and creative technologists hold a key to the community I want to live in and help evolve.</p>\n\n<p>I met Corey and Ara from Dojo 4 five months ago during Boulder Start-up week. I am fascinated by the idea of making purpose-driven work environments that build community and respect the whole person a reality for myself and more of us.</p>\n\n<p>The real work of love happens after the romance dies. It’s the hard shit. We can all dream it, but sometimes we’ll need a therapist or bike ride or Red Bull or a joint.</p>\n\n<p>Ara and I recently went to Telluride to explore how these ideas might have a confluence with some work the Telluride Foundation has started for its community.</p>\n\n<p>More accurately, I tagged along with Ara and his family - wife and two kids - car camping along the way. It was vulnerable situation for him and his family and me. We didn’t know each other all that well, but we were both going with our gut.</p>\n\n<p>My wife was like, what the fuck?!</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/i.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_08.png\" /> \nHere’s what I wrote about Dojo after we got back:</p>\n\n<p>Wondering off the street into Dojo 4 might feel like an alien encounter for a corporate suit. It may even feel that way to a 30-something dotcom executive who equates ping-pong tables and climbing walls to progressive corporate culture. It may also just seem as if the tapping on keyboards, house music, writing code and work are nothing more than early 22nd century business as usual.</p>\n\n<p>But something way more radically subtle and elegantly subversive are afoot in the small first floor workspace in the cinder block building just north of Pearl St on 17th.</p>\n\n<p>Professionals who genuinely care about what they do, their personal growth, their community of friends, families and colleagues, their larger community and the world - work in an open environment that puts as much emphasis on meaningful practice, principles, personal development, as it does on producing quality work that matters.</p>\n\n<p>Just typing this sounds like pie in the sky bullshit in most contexts. Many companies talk this shit of culture and people and purpose, but few embrace it as part of their daily routine, and even fewer see it as a business necessity.</p>\n\n<p>Dojo 4 has begun fomenting a unique perspective of place, people, practice and purpose as <em>the</em> <em>business process</em> for positive change and creating a better world.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/j.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_09.png\" /> \nWhen I look at the house I am building, I see all of the work I have done and my ego swells and I am psyched about what I am creating.</p>\n\n<p>When my love looks at our house, she may see a piece of this too, but she sees unfinished business, missed deadlines, timelines that have not matched reality, a 7-yr project that as she has said: “i don’t think i would have signed up for if i knew then what i know now.”</p>\n\n<p>That’s love after the romance, that’s pain and truth and difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Coding after the romance is some version of: “i’m tired of building bullshit stuff for bullshit companies run by dumbass fuckers who are only interested in their personal bottom line.”</p>\n\n<p>All of us have a responsibility to lean into love after the romance and do the hard work together to move past the status quo.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/love-and-code-rocky-mountain-ruby-conference-presentation/assets/k.png' alt=\"Love &amp; Code-  What happens after the romantic phase ends_Page_10.png\" /> \nI don’t have the answers that’s for sure.</p>\n\n<p>If I were wearing a t-shirt with one of my many red flags, it might read: Work in Progress Here… Much too slowly for many.</p>\n\n<p>Why am I here? Because I selfishly hope that I can be a small catalyst for the positive change I want to see in our world. And I know that I have to tidy up my thumbs, tidy up my life as part of the process.</p>\n\n<p>I want to thank my family for tolerating my crap and Courtney for loving me enough to tell me and show me when I’m wrong and how I can be a better person.</p>\n\n<p>I also know that all of you have a crazy power, one you might not even realize you have. And I want to encourage you, challenge you even to use that power to build shit that matters.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n</div>\n",
