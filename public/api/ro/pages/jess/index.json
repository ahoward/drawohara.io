i was\nlooking pretty haggard - and told me <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/EfKZnf2cSQLRKzUg7\">‚Äòyou can make it‚Äô</a>.</p>\n\n<p>the pass was almost unridable. i had to push my bike in the\n<a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/9iEW4Spxo3ryuo9K6\">wind</a> for miles and\n<a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/1MKUuyh1peyiAyN49\">miles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>the pass, drenched in sleet, had no shelter for as far as the eye could see and\nno cars on except some burned out meth dens, i wondered if i was going to be\nvery, very cold that night.  or worse.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/pages/jess/assets/the-pass.jpg' alt=\"the pass\" /></p>\n\n<p>i dropped into jacumba, noting the bridge (slightly snakey) on the edge of town\nand thinking ‚Äòi will probably sleep there‚Ä¶‚Äô.</p>\n\n<p>there seemed to be very little in town except a closed gas station.</p>\n\n<p>at the front desk of the hot springs, an airstream trailer, the girls asked what\ni was doing. when i told them, they looked at me <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/s5wsANZg3gT1BqFs5\">like i was crazy</a> said that i could have a room - it was\na posh place and sold out, too - even though i barely had enough cash for the\nsoak. i was relieved, and immediately nervous about being around people in a\nconfined space. at that point, i‚Äôd been sleeping outside for at least 4\nmonths. often with coyotes but, otherwise, very alone.</p>\n\n<p>i kept to myself. hood on. another hood on. and one more for good measure. it\nhelped with the sound too. the band, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/noelleandthedeserters\">‚Äònoel and the deserters‚Äô</a>\nwas really on a roll.  i‚Äôd had a few drinks with the musicians and was really digging it.</p>\n\n<p>no one else seemed to be quite as into as i was.</p>\n\n<p>and then she was right there.</p>\n\n<p>i couldn‚Äôt help myself. i blurted out: ‚Äòcan you feel it?‚Äô.</p>\n\n<p>because she was moving too.  we were the only two dancing.</p>\n\n<p>it‚Äôs always like that. the people that move. you just see them. next thing,\nyour lost up some god damned mountain or riding bikes in europe somewhere,\nit‚Äôs just how it works‚Ä¶ magnetic.</p>\n\n<p>she <em>definitely</em> had it.</p>\n\n<p>some people need to move to think. i am one of these. and, now i know, she is too.</p>\n\n<p>we talked. i was trying to not talk. to anyone really, but she was so easy to talk to. and she made me laugh.</p>\n\n<p>accidentally, our hands touched.</p>\n\n<p>electric.</p>\n\n<p>fuck.</p>\n\n<p>this is how is always starts.  first a girl.  next, indoor plumbing.</p>\n\n<p>what was i doing?</p>\n\n<p>but, as you might have guess, i‚Äôm only joking.  there was, in fact, zero\nhesitation or restraint of any kind.  both feet.  jump.</p>\n\n<p>that night, from the first second, it was as if we‚Äôd been married for a decade. and still loved each other madly.</p>\n\n<p>i couldn‚Äôt describe it any other way.</p>\n\n<p>it was simply, very natural.</p>\n\n<p>üêò ‚ù§Ô∏è  üêò</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/pages/jess/assets/big-snake.jpg' alt=\"big-snake\" /></p>\n\n<p>all that is to say. it was a big, big, big surprise.</p>\n\n<p>then again, i had been looking at that little spot, a no-name town, on the map\nfor 3 months, or more. it drew me in, and altered my route, as only another\nlong distance cyclist could understand. it was days off my route, with\ndangerous camps on the way but‚Ä¶ i had to go. places do that to me. this\none, had a very nice shape. you can tell from afar if you look long and hard\nenough.</p>\n\n<p>jess was there for her birthday.</p>\n\n<p>so, the next morning, i was a little surprised when she told me i could visit her in los angeles.</p>\n\n<p>i said ‚Äòyes‚Äô of course. that would be 10-15 days away, and i would need a\nshower for pretty sure by then. also, there was that other spot. the one\nderren and i had looked at on the map and the one i had been terrified of for some time.</p>\n\n<p>somehow, i know that i would not be able to pass that spot.</p>\n\n<p>it‚Äôs the place where the pacific coast highway squeezes between the hollywood hills, and the ocean. a choke point.</p>\n\n<p>i rode there the night of the la fires, and watched the lighthouse there <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/Kjipk8eKT88CtSRSA\">burn</a>.</p>\n\n<p>i have always been fascinated by fire. i used to write software for field\ncomputers forest fire fighters used to make life-depending decisions. they are\nterrible, and beautiful to see.</p>\n\n<p>i still have not ridden north of that spot. even though i ride here every day\nnow, it has been unavailable to me.</p>\n\n<p>now, we‚Äôve been to alaska, colorado, and arizona together.  somehow, we‚Äôre\nmaking a place for 3 dogs and quiet days.</p>\n\n<p>in between, there have been many more stories, some of which i plan to write\nabout here. this is a work in progress, like everyting else‚Ä¶  but, for\nreasons known only to the two of us, i felt it was important to begin.</p>\n\n<p>and that‚Äôs because i love her.</p>\n\n<p>my favorite.</p>\n\n<p>and we have new stories to start writing.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/pages/jess/assets/smile.jpg' alt=\"smile\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>[[ y‚Äôall check back soon now ya hear! ]]</strong></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",
