They should teach this to mechanical engineers.” – Gary Snyder</p>\n\n<p>Nothing annoys me more than things which beep or make sounds to get attention. From dishwashers, clocks, watches, smoke detectors, cars, to phones. All of it!</p>\n\n<p>I have none of the following in my house:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>TV</li>\n  <li>radio</li>\n  <li>alarm clock</li>\n  <li>doorbell</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Everything electronic on my 90 suburban is busted (I like it that way)\nMy phone’s ring tone is 5 seconds of silence. I do have a ‘People Under the Stairs’ sample that plays when my wife calls though - a <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/drawohara.com.mp3/18_acid_raindrops.mp3\">really pleasant flute clip</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The sounds on my computer are all turned off (except one or two bloody ones I cannot find – grrrr!)</li>\n  <li>I could never use the beeper on my watches or heart-rate monitors when I used them</li>\n  <li>Our house doesn’t even have a fire alarm (I know, I know…)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The wife likes to use the timer on the stove for - timing things on the stove - which probably makes sense to normal people but, for me, the teeny beeeeeeep when the time is up is like a spear through my head every time it goes off.</p>\n\n<p>This is really strange considering that, if I could, I’d listen to music 24x7 - even while sleeping.</p>\n\n<p>I recall my dad tearing out the ‘open door dinger’ on a new truck we’d just bought <em>in the dealer’s lot</em> before he’d get in it to drive it home so - perhaps it’s a genetic disposition.\nIn any case I am sure I am not the only one who thinks the ‘beep’ is the worst human interface design feature <em>ever</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Some of you are probably with me so far but - here is the thing - modern application design is full of crappy sounding beeps!</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>dashboard notifications</li>\n  <li>growl</li>\n  <li>little counters on web tabs</li>\n  <li>holy effing iphone notifications</li>\n  <li>facebook messaging (man how <em>do</em> I turn that one off?)</li>\n  <li>push notifications</li>\n  <li>a <em>billion</em> emails reminding us to be reminded to come back and check out what the beep is going on</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Everywhere there are little numbers of beeps stacking up in our user interfaces that, somehow, designers and developers consider less offensive than all of those things <em>actually</em> beeping every two seconds in people’s ears.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how many engineers and designers have examined the notification systems of early Unices? (And yes, that <em>is</em> plural for Unix)</p>\n\n<p>Back in the day, simple Unix programs had three choices for notifications: audible bell, visual bell, or no bell.  True story, check it out</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-bell_002dstyle\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-bell_002dstyle</a></p>\n\n<p>So riddle me this ux girl: why is that?</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, the audible bell can be a really useful tool when someone is doing many important things.  For instance, when logging in to several remote systems, doing some work, not looking at something, and needing to know when something you aren’t looking at needs attention.  It’s a known fact that only people with a nutritional deficiency which destroys the ability to think rationally, prefer this type of notification and, for this reason, the designers of Unix included it as an options for global notification.</p>\n\n<p>Another option, the visual bell, just makes the application you’re in flash a teeny bit when it wants your attention, sort of like someone flicking the lights.  It’s mildly irritating too but, for most developers, preferable to a loud beep.</p>\n\n<p>No bell, my favorite.  I’d leave out an explanation of this one except that I know some people who prefer beeps are reading this article and, for them, it bears explanation.  With no bell, an application which needs to notify someone</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>makes no sound</li>\n  <li>is silent</li>\n  <li>basically nothing happens.  it’s a mute button!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, these three simple options might not seem that powerful but, like most things in Unix, there is power in orthogonality that mere hackers cannot deduce:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Inheritance: The setting for which style of notification you want is a global setting, but can easily be set per application when launching it.  That is to say all applications inherit the default, user preferred, mechanism and keep it for their lifetime, and applications that spawn other applications (think browser tabs) inherit the setting of their parent.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Global: There is one style, audible, which doesn’t require <em>seeing</em> a particular application and which there acts globally across applications - simply letting you know that ‘something’ needs attention.  This is useful if you need to put a bunch of things in the background (minimize them) or flat out can’t see (aka. are blind).  It’s also useful for the aforementioned crazy people who just like it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Individual: There is one style, visual, which lets you quietly notice notifications from the particular application you are actively paying attention too and yet easily ignore all the others which aren’t actively on your screen.  The way this is implemented is via a small ‘flash’ of brightness in the current application. This style is also useful if you can’t hear.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With these three orthogonal concepts users have, for decades, been able to finely tune how notifications were received and by which applications in quite complicated constellations.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we all know the modern computer user needs a notification system with far more complex invariants, as you can see from my desktop:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/your-application-s-notifcations-bleeping-beep/assets/desktop.png' alt=\"desktop\" /></p>\n\n<p>Okay, my desktop is a bad example ;-)</p>\n\n<p>By the way, if the idea of defining orthogonal invariants in order to design a powerful tool is new to you - do not pass GO - proceed immediately to reading about contextual vs composable design.  Trust me though, you practice contextual design and, with notifications, that’s the bloody the problem!</p>\n\n<p>Refs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_design\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_design</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read those?  Good.  Still think user-centered design is a panacea?  Or that composable is the shiznit?</p>\n\n<p>Pop-quiz then: WHO IS THE MOST POWERFUL WIZZARD - your app or the internet?</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>Of course the answer is neither.  The internet wouldn’t be useful to people without <em>applications</em> to use it and no user-centered design process would have built the internet.  Translation: some things require a composable and modular design, like the internet and pan-application notifications, while others, like you favorite text editor require an user-centered one.</p>\n\n<p>And here we come to the crux of the issue: a non-want-to-slam-your-wee-wee-in-a-car-door approach to notifications <em>cannot be solved or implemented at the application layer</em>, it has to be solved at a global level for any user that ever uses more than one simultaneous application (aka - all of them).</p>\n\n<p>I hear the mac people frothing, but they know everyone isn’t on mac.  Besides, the unified notification systems on iOS and desktops are going to go the way of the dodo anyhow because only 1 out of a hundred applications bother to integrate with them and the rest re-invent the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>Windows people - check an iPhone to imagine what unified notifications might look like.</p>\n\n<p>Linux people - … yes, you understand these things, i’ll shut up now.</p>\n\n<p>So - what’s the answer?</p>\n\n<p>Email.</p>\n\n<p>(/me waits for laughs from the crowd to die down…)</p>\n\n<p>No really.  Check this out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>email is ultra reliable</li>\n  <li>email is ultra cheap</li>\n  <li>email is synced to all a user’s devices like freaky magic, even when they are offline!</li>\n  <li>email is über easy to integrate with in any language</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, I’m not talking about ordinary email, I’m talking about simple machine parseable emails with human readable messaging in the body and structured data supplied in attachments.  Emails like this could easily be managed by a centralized program on your device that could collate and distribute them according to a ruleset: think of email filters with some special rules to alert you in various user defined ways.  Your email client already does 95% of this, with the exception of managing any structured data or performing custom user defined actions beeping at you or having Siri read you a message that you just got followed on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>With this approach you’d gain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>unification</li>\n  <li>simplicity</li>\n  <li>archival</li>\n  <li>search</li>\n  <li>customization</li>\n  <li>and much more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So why not start doing this now?  It’s crazy right?</p>\n\n<p>Crazy, except that Google is already doing it.</p>\n\n<p>Seen this?</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/your-application-s-notifcations-bleeping-beep/assets/gmail.png' alt=\"gmail.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>There’s Google in my inbox, auto-partitioning my email into ‘Primary’, ‘Social’, and ‘Promotions’.  In one fell swoop they just made more headway into the ‘too many notifications too many places’ problem than all the developers working on their own unique systems have combined. And I don’t have to manage a damn thing that I’m not already doing.</p>\n\n<p>I think now is the time for developers and designs to start realizing their homespun notification systems are a waste of energy, annoying, and broken by design.  Now is the time to start taking about a composable, modular, system that is easy to integrate with, think about, and for users to interact with.</p>\n\n<p>In the mean time we can at least do no harm: do not invent a notification system for your application, start leveraging email for notifications now and embrace the power that ubiquity and constraints combine to produce.</p>\n\n<p>BEEEEEEEP – this rant is over.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

I was struck by two things: (1) the culture at Swift felt fresh, organic, emergent, born out of the actual lived experience of the founders and their employees vs. a foreign adopted model that was born in a theoretical vacuum, and (2) many of the things that they identified as being vital to their culture are things that dojo4 does naturally as well. Such as…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a Physical Environment That Fosters Collaboration</strong></p>\n\n<p>dojo4 actually was first conceived of as a co-working space &amp; businesses. After they pivoted to become the code &amp; design consulting/services shop they are now, they kept the collaborative ethos alive by: having an open door policy, creating and hosting events for the community, and not having assigned seats in the office.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Establish Traditions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apart from the recurring events dojo4 hosts for the community, they also have lunch together on Fridays, host mindful/awareness meditation and yoga. They begin and end their stand up and other meetings with a bow and clap, riffing off of the martial arts theme of the dojo and bringing in a practice from Co-owner/COO, Corey Kohn’s meditation background  (read her <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/a-bow-and-a-clap\">blog</a>, and Brad Feld’s <a href=\"http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2014/02/bow-bow.html\">blog</a> on using the same practice).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Realize that Work Family Is Not the Only Family</strong></p>\n\n<p>The article mentions bringing dogs to work, having employee family members come and go through out the day, and that swift covers 100% of health insurance costs for every employee. dojo4 does all of these things and more. They have monthly chair messages, an open tab at <a href=\"http://www.boxcarcoffeeroasters.com\">Boxcar Coffee Roasters</a>, a great maternity <strong><em>and</em></strong> Paternity policy, among other benefits.</p>\n\n<p>The article mentioned four other practices, (1) define your values and put them center stage, (2) no nonsense hiring, (3) incorporate leadership training, and feedback, and (4) allow yourself to be picky when taking on new work. All of these happen in less defined ways at dojo4 as well, and together with my businesses partner Sam Elmore (shh…announcement pending) we are currently collaborating with the team to help give them more form.</p>\n\n<p>Companies like these are so inspiring to me. They are playing the long game; realizing what is good for the whole human being, is good for business, and good for the world.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

It is a thoroughly enjoyable time when it does.</p>\n\n<p>This edition, <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1403_02-08_mickens.pdf\">To Wash It All Away</a>, does not disappoint.</p>\n\n<p>The nugget I learned today about JavaScript from James.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“\\r\\n\\t” == false</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>WTF? I had to try it out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-bash highlighter-rouge\"><code class='code' style='white-space:pre;'><div class='code-line code-line-1'>\n</div><div class='code-line code-line-2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;node\n</div><div class='code-line code-line-3'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #0550ae\">&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #0a3069\">\"</span><span style=\"color: #0a3069\">\\r\\n\\t</span><span style=\"color: #0a3069\">\"</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #0550ae\">==</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #953800\">false</span>\n</div><div class='code-line code-line-4'><span style=\"color: #953800\">    true</span>\n</div><div class='code-line code-line-5'>\n</div></code></div>\n\n<p>And of course, the explanation from James:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here’s why: the browser detects that the two operands have different types, so it converts false to 0 and retries the comparison. The operands still have different types (string and number), so the browser coerces “\\r\\n\\t” into the number 0, because somehow, a non-zero number of characters is equal to 0. Voila—0 equals 0! AWESOME. That explanation was like the plot to Inception, but the implanted idea was “the correctness of your program has been coerced to false.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Really, I just had to share.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. <a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat\">WAT</a></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

The development of each one has been mostly like eating glass.  This tale, however, is one of happiness and commits that flow like spring flood waters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n\n<p>Many moons ago dojo4 had a simple static website</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/kung-fu.png' alt=\"kung-fu\" /></p>\n\n<p>This was fun, we changed it daily and enjoyed the creative freedom that only static can bring.</p>\n\n<p>Of course we eventually had to grow up: we designed things, we ‘needed’ a CMS, budgets were allocated.  We launched a new site, based on <a href=\"http://refinerycms.com/\">Refinery</a>, in the hopes that people would continue to hack, to play, in the awesome sauce that a Rails’ backed CMS should bring</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/refinery.png' alt=\"refinery\" /></p>\n\n<p>No one hacked.  No one played.</p>\n\n<p>(well <a href=\"http://www.brettgoulder.com/\">Brett</a> did do one sweet konami code thing that involved unicorns pooping rainbows, but that’s the subject of another post…)</p>\n\n<p>Our next iteration was the ‘craftsmen’ edition.  Homespun fucking everything: ground up re-brand, custom crazy design.  Custom Rails.  Custom Javascript.  The works.</p>\n\n<p>Before we did it I had reservations: why not simply return to static?  Learn a little code.  Write some HTMLz.  What’s the big deal?</p>\n\n<p>I gave in.  People were convinced that <em>only</em> a fancy UI would allow\nnon-technical authors to publish.</p>\n\n<p>So we did it.  Built a really great custom toolchain. It <em>was</em> beautiful</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/dj4.png' alt=\"dj4\" /></p>\n\n<p>We enjoyed our custom solution for quite a while.  But then we noticed\nsomething.</p>\n\n<p>No one hacked.  No new design happened.  The same people wrote.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that the barrier to writing isn’t, and never has been, a technical one: people write because they must, no matter what the tooling.  Every one else simply cannot or will not write, sexy interface or not.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that the people that want to open up the can of creative whoop-ass on web site, lo and behold, aren’t designers, they aren’t backend developers, they are front-end engineers that can power 10,000 lines of CSS before breakfast.  They are people don’t want to muck with database migrations, with servers and processes, with complicated deployments; these things simply get in the way of 1000 watts of front-end talent.</p>\n\n<p>So we started over again.</p>\n\n<p>It began with quiet conversations with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wouldthatiwere\">Steve</a>.  We talked about rebuilding the site in a day - beautiful and static.  Liberating ourselves from the ball and chain a server, database, and admin interfaces bring with them.  And then, we did it in a weekend:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/commits.png' alt=\"commits\" /></p>\n\n<p>Our new site is %100 static:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/static.png' alt=\"static\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yet <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog\">content is developed and deployed every day</a></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/content.png' alt=\"content\" /></p>\n\n<p>The rest of this story is about how we did it, and how you should too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"now\">Now</h2>\n\n<p>We love building sites with <a href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\">Middleman</a>.  It’s a simple static site generator that lets us stay in Ruby while building data driven, templated, and well-factored websites.  The benefits of this toolchain cannot be overstated.  When dojo4 builds something on this toolchain, front-end engineers are fully liberated - sorta like reaching nirvana - but more like not being bogged down getting some backend developer to come up for air to implement some data interaction needed to drive the view layer.  Designers are liberated too: freed from rigid frameworks, slow times to pivot concepts, and complicated infrastructure required to put something into people’s hands to solicit feedback.  Middleman solves all this and so much more.  There are many other players in the static site generator space, and I encourage you to <a href=\"http://staticsitegenerators.net/\">check them all out</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bitballoon.com/\">BitBalloon</a> is everything you wanted from Amazon’s S3, but were afraid to ask.  Build your static site and deploy in 3 lines of code.  Let BitBalloon handle asset minification, image compression, content negotiation, and pushing everything out onto Akamai to be stupid fast.  It’s sprockets as a service, and s3 on steroids - eating meat and pumping iron.  It’s that awesome.  Oh yeah, they do atomic deploys and rollback for you too.  Did I mention not needing a server and the <a href=\"https://www.bitballoon.com/pricing\">wicked cheap</a> part?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://draftin.com\">DraftIn</a>.  This part starts to get crazy y’all…  So some of you are probably thinking - how lame must it be to publish content when you have to write code all day long!?  DraftIn has you covered.  It’s the bestest writing tool of all time; try it now and you’ll see: nothing beats the workflow of writing markdown, soliciting feedback, easily managing edits from a dozen contributing authors, and finally getting ready to publish your content. They even have an army of editors sitting their you can click to solicit - getting your stuff edited for a teeny fee by NDA signed professional editors.  DraftIn just does writing, but they support the notion of pushing content (via WebHooks) to every service from WordPress to Tumblr to Facebook.  They also support pushing to arbitrary robots listening in the cloudz.</p>\n\n<p>We have such a robot</p>\n\n<p>She is a teeny robot that listens for publishing events from DraftIn, captures the content, commits it to git, builds the site with Middleman, and then deploys via BitBallon to produce what is currently <a href=\"http://dojo4.com\">http://dojo4.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In plain english we use draft to write content, push a button, and then a teeny robot captures the content, compiles it, and deploy our website.  This gives us an awesome editing experience - superior to any workflow of any CMS on the market - and a super simple, fast, and robust website.</p>\n\n<p>The result of combining the above three players is like chocolate, with peanut butter, plus bacon.</p>\n\n<p>The flow we experience is simply awesome:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>First we write using DraftIn’s tools.  I’m doing this now. <img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/draftin.png' alt=\"editing\" /></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Next, we publish to dojo4’s robot <img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/publish.png' alt=\"publish\" /></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The robot informs us of her progress <img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/robot.png' alt=\"robot\" /></p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Content shows up, and even renders, on <a href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a> <img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/github.png' alt=\"github\" /> <img src='/ro/dojo4/static-is-the-new-black/assets/nova.png' alt=\"nova\" /></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And, a few minutes a new <a href=\"http://dojo4.com\">http://dojo4.com</a> is born.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"too-long-do-read\">Too Long; Do Read.</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"writers-write\">Writers write.</h3>\n\n<p>Other’s don’t.  No tool in the world will cause creative kundalini energy to wake someone up at 3am to post a new blog.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"static-is-magic\">Static is magic.</h3>\n\n<p>Give up reasoning about caching: just cache it all NOW.  Static serves like lighting, for next to zero cost, and it unshackles the inner designer of everyone that touches the code.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"github-is-king\">GitHub is king.</h3>\n\n<p>You want all your content in revision control.  We can roll our entire site back <em>exactly</em> as it was 7 days, 4 hours, and 2 minutes ago including styles and data.  We can pinpoint every single change, no matter how small, that was made to our website by whom and when; we can undo these changes too.  We can re-create our entire site in seconds on any platform capable of serving simple HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Can you?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"design-is-dead\">Design is dead.</h3>\n\n<p>I don’t know what you call it, but the people that are building the modern web are technicians - front-end engineers.  The proliferation of devices, technologies, and expectations has kersploded into a landscape that can only be managed by people with meticulous notes in moleskines that obsess over web standards and - wait for it - code.  Ideas have gotten complicated and the ancient ‘design and build’ philosophy that worked with 960 pixel screens (for a week) has gone the way of the Dojo.  Er, Dodo.</p>\n\n<p>We aren’t in Kansas anymore and your designer had better know how to code.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"epilogue\">Epilogue</h2>\n\n<p>There is so much more I’d like to say about why going static is awesome.  Awesome seeing everyone in the shop contribute to the code in the <em>first week</em> after being deployed.  Awesome seeing new bits of <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/fun\">creativity come to life</a>.  Awesome seeing <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/today-s-moment-of-zen\">new people writing</a>.  Awesome sleeping at night and not giving a shit if ‘the server is up’.  Awesome spending 10x less money doing something 10x better than anything we’ve done before.</p>\n\n<p>But that’ll have to wait - we’ve got more beautiful, screaming fast, responsive static sites to build.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"coming-soon\">Coming Soon</h2>\n\n<p>In the next installment I’ll write about how we are taking our site build time from 180 seconds, down to 3.  With no new tooling.  On Ruby.  In about 100 lines of code.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"refs\">Refs</h2>\n\n<p>For those of you that prefer to read code over blogs, here’s the money shot:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the entire dojo4.com, sans a bunch of content and some passwords <a href=\"http://assets.dojo4.com.s3.amazonaws.com/m.tgz\">middleman app</a></li>\n  <li>the draftin/webhook, lacking only config <a href=\"http://assets.dojo4.com.s3.amazonaws.com/r.tgz\">rack app</a> that listens for our posts, compiles, and then deploys the site on our behalf</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n",

Not our usual excellent <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/clients\">client work</a> or <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/static-is-the-new-black\">mad science</a>, but something different. Something… <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/fun/moshi-moshi-co\">fun</a>!</p>\n\n<p>Well the (not so) secret is out. There’s a new product group at dojo4 led by me, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ryan-cook\">Ryan</a>, called <a href=\"http://gomoshimoshi.com/\">Moshi Moshi Co.</a> and it has been in the works for a long, long while. We’re focusing on purposeful products for communities as well as experimenting with some smaller concepts. Our first experiment is <a href=\"https://speakteesy.com/\">Speakteesy</a> and was built last year to experiment with process and has already been shut down. <a href=\"http://emailadore.com/\">Emailadore</a> came about earlier this year and is in use at our office daily.</p>\n\n<p>Our biggest undertaking to date though is <a href=\"http://wallspacefinder.com/\">Wallspace Finder</a>. At its core, WSF is a product that helps solve an age-old problem for artists: how can I show more art in my community? So, we’re building a community of artists and spaces and helping them connect. Artists we’ve interviewed so far, especially those who are outside of the gallery circuit, have been very receptive and as excited as we are.</p>\n\n<p>We’re going to be increasing the frequency of product development and, for each iteration, we’ll be soliciting feedback from an inner cabal of entrepreneurs, developers, designers, and investors. If you’re interested an early look at our products, pumped about partnering, or generally just want to give us a high-five, never feel bad about <a href=\"mailto:ryan@dojo4.com\">reaching out</a>.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

St. Patrick’s day was the first such opportunity to give this a go. We rolled out the green and were mighty pleased with ourselves as we sipped giant steins of Guinness.</p>\n\n<p>Then, disaster struck. We learned of the lame <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/17/no-brewers-and-no-mayor-in-new-yorks-st-patricks-day-parade/\">situations</a> in New York Citay and Boston where LGBTQ folks (in particular gay vets) were being excluded from marching in the parade. This led to a boycott of the parades by mayors and brewers alike. We too were all like, “not on my watch, suckas.” We took down the green. Peace was restored.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t long before we started to miss the green like a leprechaun misses his pot of gold. We wanted it back, but we didn’t want to seem like we were giving in.</p>\n\n<p>We reevaluated the situation and decided that in this particular instance, doing something was going to make more of a statement than doing nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the green is back and badder than ever. And to make sure we’re not misunderstood, we added a little rainbow to the logo… ya know, ‘cause leprechauns love rainbows.</p>\n\n<p>Happy St. Paddy’s Day!!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

So awesome, that there’s a group of amazing people working to make Boulder even awesome-er and we at dojo4 help them any way we can.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org\">Awesome Boulder</a> is the local chapter of the <a href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/\">Awesome Foundation</a>, which grants $1,000 a month to local projects working to improve the community in some way. AwesomeBoulder has been running for 25 months and funded 25 projects for a total of $25,000 given out to local projects. You can see the full list of funded projects on <a href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/boulder\">their chapter page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Dojo4 believes in this organization, so we help out by acting on their board of trustees, making a monthly monetary donation, and hosting all of their events and meetings at our office. We also improved their website at awesomeboulder.org pro-bono. Their site started as a simple landing page with an explanation and a link to apply at the Awesome Foundation’s website.</p>\n\n<p>The page did a good job of explaining the process of getting funded, but a major administrative challenge was reminding each donor to write a check each month to Awesome Boulder. So we turned their landing page into a full Rails app so that they could allow their donors to automatically make their contribution each month. This change also allows them to build and publish a blog, and have flexibility over their application process should they want to change it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>We’re looking forward to seeing what awesome projects they support next!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

Over on the right, there under the “Experiments” banner, lies your newest email technology friend named <a href=\"http://emailadore.com/\">Emailadore</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://emailadore.com/\"><img src=\"http://emailadore.com/images/ea-logo.png\" alt=\"Emailadore Logo\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This idea was a part of our normal venture selection process that we used to select <a href=\"http://wallspacefinder.com/\">Wallspace Finder</a> and received some serious consideration, but we felt that it could use a different approach. During a weekend in February, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard\">Ara</a> hunkered down and accelerated the process from 0 to launch. When we arrived on that Monday, we had a functional Emailadore in our laps to try out.</p>\n\n<p>To get started with (read: sign up) for Emailadore, simply send/forward any email to <a href=\"mailto:email@emailadore.com\">email@emailadore.com</a>. Immediately, you will be returned a link to a spartan webpage we’ve created with your email content &amp; attachments as well as a separate email to activate your account. At this time, logging into the website with your account simply affords you a list of all the emails you’ve sent us. Anytime you send us something we’ll respond with a new link to a webpage that is instantly shareable, private with a non-guessable URL, and not indexable by search engines.</p>\n\n<p>So, what were we thinking? Well, as an agency, part of our core responsibility is multitasking. We’re in email all day, have multiple project management systems open, are active on chat and IM, and occasionally touch CRM and customer support systems. We don’t message or communicate effectively in those systems though. The experience is too stuttered and segmented. Instead, we use <a href=\"http://emailadore.com/\">Emailadore</a> to communicate where it feels natural and then easily save a record of it when we’re ready.</p>\n\n<p>For now, it’s free to use and we’re putting some miles on it. Go ahead and <a href=\"mailto:email@emailadore.com\">send it something</a> and let us know what you think about the result. You can contact me at <a href=\"mailto:ryan@dojo4.com\">ryan@dojo4.com</a> or get at all of us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dojo4\">@dojo4</a>.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W1tzURKYFNs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n",

We have a pattern of ajax calling an rpc method in our rails app when we just need to get some information or post a simple object like favoriting a user or something. The code that runs on our rails server that handles that ajax request won’t blow up the whole server and automatically invoke Better Errors, so the work around is to go to a special url that better errors exposes to show the last error thrown in our rails code: http://localhost:3000/__better_errors.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else out there used this tool?

(temporarily Dave!)</p>\n\n<p>There is an army of developers, listed as contributors to the offending repos, who will argue until they’re red in the face about all sorts of things like editors, languages, frameworks, platforms, css grids, and testing frameworks.  These same developers will check sensitive passwords into a <em>repository</em>, to be preserved like amber in a icy cave, because they just can’t be bothered to write 100 lines of code to properly encrypt stuff that <em>should never be in a repo</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are one of those developers please stick an onion slice in you pee-hole and ponder this a bit.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a company that practices this anti-pattern please use the entire onion.</p>\n\n<p>If you write frameworks that encourage the use of ‘config/hack-my-db-little-pony.yml’ use the entire bag.</p>\n\n<p>OpenSSl isn’t that hard.  Encrypt your shit.  At least encrypt your client’s shit.</p>\n\n<p>Just <em>don’t</em> leave the password your boss, client, or founders use for <em>everything else</em> (because you know they do) lying in the cryogenic freeze of a GitHub repo.  Public <em>or</em> private.</p>\n\n<p>The design patterns to solve this are simple;</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/ahoward/sekrets\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ahoward/sekrets</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>is one.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in Ruby, you can flat out <em>have</em> this one.</p>\n\n<p>If not please write one in your language of choice.</p>\n\n<p>But whatever you do, don’t be lazy when it comes to checking in passwords.  It’s just completely and totally - amateur hour #weaksauce.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

People are sitting on the floor of dojo4 doing seemingly nothing on a regular basis. <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/in-your-minds-browser-clear-your-cache-every-tuesday-morning\">For years we did it every Tuesday morning</a>, then there was a bit of a lag, but with <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ryan-cook\">Ryan</a>’s encouragement, we’ve started doing it again recently. Tell your friends: dojo4 hosts meditation every Thursday 1:00-1:20pm. You can come, and so can anyone else who wants to.</p>\n\n<p>And we’re not the only ones doing it (<a href=\"http://bigthink.com/amped/meditation-is-the-new-yoga-bringing-mindfulness-into-the-workplace\">obviously</a>). Here in Boulder, our friends at <a href=\"http://one.valeski.org/2014/01/day-in-pictures-another-awesome-tuesday.html\">Gnip</a> and the <a href=\"http://http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2014/02/two-weeks-meditation.html\">Foundry Group</a>, to name a few, are fiends for it, too. And for good reason: <a href=\"http://startupguide.com/tag/meditation/\">the positive effects of meditation include stress relief, better health, creativity, increased brain function, mental focus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3013333/unplug/3-reasons-everyone-at-google-is-meditating\">emotionally intelligent, resilient and more</a>. Apparently, it’s also <a href=\"http://https://www.eventbrite.com/e/meditation-the-startups-secret-weapon-tickets-7388997691\">the startup’s secret weapon for fostering more effective leadership &amp; organizational collaboration</a>. Not mention that there’s a good chance that it’ll make you at least 42% <a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2013/may-june-13/the-compassionate-mind.html\">happier</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But what’s coolest to me is that <strong>meditation doesn’t actually do anything</strong> in itself. It doesn’t make you a better person. It doesn’t make you more likeable, more efficient, kinder, smarter or more accomplishing. You have to do that yourself. All meditation does is make it easier to notice [what’s actually happening] right now. And that makes it more likely that you might notice things about yourself. And that can lead to being more likeable, more efficient, kinder, smarter or more accomplishing. Or not. Up to you…</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

But there was a problem. Some unrest. Their ecommerce vendor was being unreliable, tyrannical even! So, they called on the dojo to help.</p>\n\n<p>Sinskey had selected <a href=\"http://www.vin65.com/\">Vin65</a> to replace their previous vendor and asked us to find the best way to integrate the new system with their existing site and infrastructure to restore some sense of peace and normalcy to their sunny vineyard. The dream was to have Vin65 integration be as seamless and invisible as possible – this is <em>not</em> the typical use case for Vin65.</p>\n\n<p>Vin65 does offer a set of JavaScript widgets to assist with remote integration. While these are incredibly useful, realization of the ultimate goal still required a good deal of contorting.</p>\n\n<p>We integrated the widgets, restyled the micro-cart and wine listing pages. We also wrote custom javascript to reroute Vin65 hosted pages back to robertsinskey.com. On the backend, we got the Vin65 API to play nicely with BrowserCMS in order to dynamically pull in wines and track inventory.</p>\n\n<p>As with any API/non-custom solution, there were dragons to slay and frogs to kiss.

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Hosting, DNS &amp; HTTPS often require the interactions of more than a few providers.  Often becoming unwieldily if not managed effectively.</p>\n\n<p>DNS requires both record management and domain registration.  For both Dojo4 has employed <a href=\"http://dyn.com/dns\">DyDNS</a> for many years.</p>\n\n<p>Dojo4 generally uses <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\">Amazon AWS EC2 cloud computers</a> for hosting and as such tend to use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing\">AWS ELB load balancers</a> in front of those web hosts.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn’t give you a consistent IP addresses for ELB instances and so consequently the only way to create second level domain records pointing to ELB instances is to use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/route53\">Amazon AWS Route53</a> for record management which has a special alias record for the purpose.  So, we tend to use Route53 for DNS record management.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the way TLS handshakes are negotiated by linux/apache you are limited to the number of SSL certificates that can be served to the number of IP’s on the host.  With EC2 this is basically a single cert if you are not using a <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/vpc\">VPC</a>.  Dojo4 often uses ELB’s to provide SSL as a means to get around this.</p>\n\n<p>DNS &amp; HTTPS are closely related as the domains and subdomains to be secured must be enumerated prior to certificate provisioning.  Often the most convenient and flexible strategy is to get a wildcard cert.  Note, though, that not all wildcard certificate issuers include the base domain in the certificate (so you can only use the cert to protect *.somedomain.com, and not somedomain.com).  The $100/year wildcard certificate from <a href=\"dnsimple.com\">dnsimple.com</a> issued by <a href=\"http://comodo.com\">Comodo</a> and including the base domain is a good value even with the $96 ($8/month * 12 months) dnsimple dns hosting cost.</p>\n\n<p>dnsimple has some other convenient features such as being able to delegate management of records set to other dnsimple user accounts.  As we have moved record set management from DynDNS to Route53, and are having an account on dnsimple for SSL provisioning, we went ahead and moved domain registration from DynDNS to dnsimple to consolidate services.</p>\n\n<p>Some handy command-liners:</p>\n\n<p>Find the Start Of Authority for a DNS record</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>dig SOA dojo4.com</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>View the certificate that a host is serving</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>openssl s_client -showcerts -connect dojo4.com:443 &lt; /dev/null</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Access a web server by IP ignoring SSL verification</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>curl -k <a href=\"https://184.72.61.241\" target=\"_blank\">https://184.72.61.241</a> -H “Host: projects.dojo4.com”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "\n<p>\n  The future of web layouts is <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-flexbox/\" target=\"_blank\">promising</a>, especially for the wizened web dev whose deeply nested tables still <a href=\"http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">haunt the internet</a>. But, until flexbox is ready for prime time, CSS floats&mdash;the core layout mechanism for CSS frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation&mdash;will have to suffice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Or will they?\n</p>\n\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/the-shadow-world-of-css-tables/assets/display-table.gif' />\n\n<p>\n  Some of today's brilliant young web cats might not be aware that there was a vacuum created when TABLE-based layouts were dethroned. <a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Zen Garden</a>, which showcased the promise of CSS layouts and put a dagger in the heart of TABLE-based ones, didn't necessarily coronate a successor.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  There was the Holy Grail technique, Faux Absolute Positioning, and many other slices of <a href=\"http://www.positioniseverything.net/\" target=\"_blank\">PIE</a>. It was a time of experimentation, the spirit of which has dimmed a bit in light of all the lovely frameworks out there (though some folks still <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/suit-grid-layouts\" target=\"_blank\">experiment</a> from time to time).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  One technique that failed to gain traction was CSS table layouts. A number of things conspired against it:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    the title of the book advocating for it, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0980455227\" target=\"_blank\">Everything you know about CSS is wrong</a>, was, let's face it, a little alienating\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    the technique's very name conjured up demons of times past (TABLE layouts!)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    it was ahead of its time&mdash;before two important browsers of the epoch supported it (IE6/IE7)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n  But recently, a number of folks have revisited the technique because, in a line or two of code, it enables positioning that other techniques cannot without hacks or JS. Moreover, it offers source-ordering sleights of hand that come in handy in responsive contexts.\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vertical-centering\">\n  Vertical centering\n</h2>\n\n<p>\n  Frontend devs are familiar with the challenge of aligning elements vertically in a row when heights are unknown. Indeed, it's usually the first problem one has to solve in any site's <code>HEADER</code> (logo and navigation).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <code>TABLE</code>s made vertical centering easy with the <code>VALIGN</code> attribute. In float-based layouts, things are <a href=\"http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/09/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/\" target=\"_blank\">much murkier</a>, requiring lots of trickery (positioning, padding, or line-heights usually).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Enter CSS tables, which make vertical centering trivial with the <code>vertical-align: middle</code> property. To illustrate, take the following markup:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n  <pre>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"row-table\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"cell\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n        foo\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"cell\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n        bar\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"cell\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n        baz\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;div</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"cell\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n        foo<span class=\"nt\">&lt;br&gt;</span>bar<span class=\"nt\">&lt;br&gt;</span>baz<span class=\"nt\">&lt;br&gt;</span>qux\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/div&gt;</span>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  Combine it with the following CSS:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n  <pre>\n    <span class=\"nc\">.row-table</span> {\n      <span class=\"nl\">display</span>: <span class=\"m\">table</span>;\n      <span class=\"nl\">table-layout</span>: <span class=\"m\">fixed</span>;\n      <span class=\"nl\">width</span>: <span class=\"m\">100%</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"nc\">.cell</span> {\n      <span class=\"nl\">display</span>: <span class=\"m\">table-cell</span>;\n      <span class=\"nl\">width</span>: <span class=\"m\">25%</span>;\n      <span class=\"nl\">vertical-align</span>: <span class=\"m\">middle</span>;\n    }\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  And you get the following vertically centered layout, despite the last column's taller content:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row-table\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\">\n      foo\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\">\n      bar\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\">\n      baz\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\">\n      foo<br>bar<br>baz<br>qux\n    </div>\n  \n</div>\n\n<p>\n  An added advantage of this method is that most backend devs <em>just get</em> <code>TABLE</code>s (I'm looking at you, <a href=\"/team/ara-t-howard\" target=\"_blank\">Ara</a>). So, if you write styles for other people to use, you can create an OOCSS grid system with intuitive classes and sub-classes (\".col\", \".col-valign-middle\", \".col-valign-top\", etc) to make their lives easier.\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"equal-height-columns\">\n  Equal height columns\n</h2>\n\n<p>\n  With the same markup as above, it's quite easy to create equal height columns; we'll just add some background colors to demonstrate:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row-table\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#F05F3B\">\n      foo\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#E7E5D7\">\n      bar\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#777777\">\n      baz\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#55ACAA\">\n      foo<br>bar<br>baz<br>qux\n    </div>\n  \n</div>\n\n<p>\n  Sure, there are JS libraries that make floated columns do this, but there's all kinds of window-resizing funny business one has to do in a responsive context to prevent the columns' (JS-calculated) heights from trickling down to smaller viewports.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Instead, with a simple media query, I can make CSS tables transform into blocks (<code>display: block</code>) or table groups (<code>display: table-header-group</code>) depending on what's appropriate for the given context.\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"source-ordering-tricks\">\n  Source ordering tricks\n</h2>\n\n<p>\n  CSS table properties can come in handy when you want to re-shuffle the hand you were dealt by the HTML source order. In float-based layouts, you can push and pull elements in larger viewports, but things will stack up the same as the HTML source order on smaller ones.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  CSS tables allow you to significantly reorder things, particularly on smaller viewports. Take our previous example, for instance:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row-table\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#F05F3B;\">\n      0\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#E7E5D7;\">\n      1\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#777777;\">\n      2\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#55ACAA;\">\n      3\n    </div>\n  \n</div>\n\n<p>\n  By changing the display setting to one of the table group properties (<code>display: table-caption</code>, <code>display: table-header-group</code>, <code>display: table-row-group</code>, or <code>display: table-footer-group</code>), we can stack elements quite differently than they appear in the row layout on larger viewports (than the source order).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  For instance, if we wanted the columns above to stack in the following order (2,3,1,0), we'd apply the following display properties to the cells (from left to right): <code>display: table-footer-group</code> (0), <code>display: table-row-group</code> (1), <code>display: table-caption</code> (2), <code>display: table-header-group</code> (3). And the cells would then stack like so:\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row-table\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\">\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"width:100%;display:table-footer-group;color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#F05F3B;\">\n      0\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"width:100%;display:table-row-group;color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#E7E5D7;\">\n      1\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"width:100%;display:table-caption;color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#777777;\">\n      2\n    </div>\n  \n  \n    <div class=\"cell\" style=\"width:100%;display:table-header-group;color:rgba(0,0,0, 0.6);background-color:#55ACAA;\">\n      3\n    </div>\n  \n</div>\n\n<p>\n  Note: I had to add a <code>width: 100%</code> rule to the <code>display: table-caption</code> element because otherwise it would not fill up the available space.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Why the heck would you want to do that?! Well, you might be doing one of those clever <a href=\"http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/#footer-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">footer navigation tricks</a> for small viewports and want all the nav that's in your <code>HEADER</code> to snap down to the bottom of the page.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Or maybe you just have some column in a row that should be viewed first on small viewports but is displayed in the middle of a row on larger viewports.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The possibilities are <strong>NOT</strong> endless or nearly as robust as flexbox's will be, but it's something to tuck away in the back of your toolbox.\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"notes\">\n  Notes\n</h2>\n\n<p>\n  CSS tables were supported in Internet Explorer starting with IE8. Otherwise, support is <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/css-table\" target=\"_blank\">quite robust</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Although <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0980455227\" target=\"_blank\">Everything You Know about CSS Is Wrong</a> might sound like a daunting book title, it's actually a good read&mdash;and some of the comments on Amazon are amusing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  If you're entertaining the idea of putting something like a scrollable carousel inside a CSS table cell, study up on the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/table-layout\" target=\"_blank\">table-layout</a> property, in particular the \"fixed\" value. This prevents the cell from growing to contain its contents and incidentally can decrease rendering times because browsers don't have to calculate all the various widths of all the various contents of your cells.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  I've run across a peculiar bug in Firefox concerning positioning elements within HTML and CSS table cells. The \"path of least markup\" solution, discovered by a current Mozilla employee, is to give both the table row and cell <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/table-cell-position-absolute\" target=\"_blank\">a height of 100%</a>. Another well-documented workaround is to use an element inside the cell to establish a positioning context.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Ian Yates wrote an excellent <a href=\"http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-role-of-table-layouts-in-responsive-web-design--webdesign-10294\" target=\"_blank\">Tuts+ article</a> about using CSS tables for ad blocks, which tend to represent fixed components in a liquid layout.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n  Ben Frain has done some really interesting <a href=\"http://benfrain.com/css-performance-test-flexbox-v-css-table-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">performance tests</a> comparing flexbox to CSS tables. His caveats about sample size and lack of true specs for flexbox should be noted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Roger Johansson <a href=\"http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201110/using_displaytable_has_semantic_effects_in_some_screen_readers/\" target=\"_blank\">noted in October, 2011</a> that some screen-readers treat CSS tables as HTML tables, which is a drag. Maybe that's changed in the past two and a half years?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Like anyone working on the internet, I make lots of mistakes.

The open source code that resulted from building several native apps that included web content was the <a href=\"https://github.com/Imbed\">Imbed project</a>. We released the <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/announcing-imbed-the-best-way-to-use-web-content-in-an-i-os-app\">iOS version first</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to be a starting point for what we think is the best way to incorporate web content into a native app - using native code. In iOS that means writing Objective-C to use a UIWebView and in Android that means writing Java to use a WebView. Yes, this requires that you know enough about iOS/Objective-C and Android/Java to write your own native functions when you want to use device features, but that means being able to follow Apple &amp; Google’s directions exactly and not depend on a third party to support a new feature and support it without bugs of its own.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I’ve been diving deeper into Android research and have created the <a href=\"https://github.com/imbed/android\">Android version of Imbed</a>. In addition to providing a nice starting point for including web content, the example html code demonstrates some javascript limitations in the webview and provides built-in support for the all-important back button on Android phones when you click a link that needs opening in Chrome vs in the web content within your app.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/imbed/android\">Android version</a> and let me know your thoughts on twitter!</p>\n\n<p>As always, pull requests welcome :)</p>\n\n</div>\n",
