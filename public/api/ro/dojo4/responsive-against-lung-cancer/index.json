Most recently we implemented a responsive design for their <a href=\"http://www.standup2cancer.org/lungcancer/\">lung cancer campaign</a>. We were able to implement design and Tony Goldwynâ€™s embedded PSA video responsively to be effective, look great and get this important message across within any screen size.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/lung-cancer/resources/facts-figures/lung-cancer-fact-sheet.html\">Lung cancer is leading cause of cancer deaths accounting for approximately 27 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States</a>. And Stand Up to Cancer is helping fund <a href=\"http://www.standup2cancer.org/dream_teams/view/su2c_acs_lung_cancer_dream_team\">research</a> that is giving lung cancer patients options that have never been available to them before.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
