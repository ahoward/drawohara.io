The total elevation gain and loss is nearly 515,000 feet, and much of it is hardscrabble rock barely identifiable as a trail.”</em></p>\n\n<p>We at the dojo are cheering for our old friend &amp; client, <a href=\"http://scottjurek.com/\">Scott Jurek</a> as he <a href=\"http://www.outsideonline.com/1997316/will-scott-jurek-break-appalachian-trail-record-maybe\">attempts to break the speed record for the AT</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012 we had the enjoyable experience of building a fast-loading <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/static-is-the-new-black\">static website</a> for Scott, to coincide with the launch of his memoir, <a href=\"http://scottjurek.com/eatandrun/\"><em>Eat &amp; Run</em></a>. We worked together to create a visually cohesive brand as well as to incorporate a blog and a calendar plugin that he could edit.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/cheering-for-our-friend-scott-jurek/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-09 at 3.19.19 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We love the site and we love the man.  This quote from <em>Eat &amp; Run</em> could easily have come from our CTO, Ara Howard:</p>\n\n<p>“There’s a joy to discomfort and pain. Any time you push through a barrier of discomfort there’s an ease and a lightness on the other side.”  May that philosophy carry him swiftly into yet another mind-boggling ultra-running record!</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/cheering-for-our-friend-scott-jurek/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-09 at 3.19.55 PM.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"update\">UPDATE</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/trail-racing/scott-jurek-celebrates-a-new-appalachian-trail-thru-hike-speed-record\">HE DID IT!</a></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",
