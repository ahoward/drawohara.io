It was originally slated to be held downtown but when the number of RSVPs climbed to close to 300, we decided to move it out to the <a title=\"http://assets.flavorwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome_1985-image-497780-1024x687.jpg\" href=\"http://assets.flavorwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome_1985-image-497780-1024x687.jpg\">Bartertown</a> neighborhood of Boulder. Despite (or maybe because of) the move, the turnout persisted in being phenomenal and included a whole range of folk, from those who already died-hard members of the Hub to those who came just to find out more. <span><a title=\"http://www.impactassets.org/about-us/team/timothy-freundlich/\" href=\"http://www.impactassets.org/about-us/team/timothy-freundlich/\">Tim Freundlich</a>\n</span> was on hand to talk about <a title=\"hhttp://hub-ventures.com/\" href=\"hhttp://hub-ventures.com/\">Hub Ventures</a>' support for Hub Boulder and the vision for the next ten years  of having <a title=\"http://www.the-hub.net/\" href=\"http://www.the-hub.net/\">Hubs</a> in every <a title=\"http://www.the-hub.net/network\" href=\"http://www.the-hub.net/network\">major metropolitan city in the world</a> with a membership of over 2 million change-makers, social innovators, and entrepreneurs cultivating the common good.
