It seemed to have undergone a complete rewrite recently but only had PHP and Python implementations.</p>\n\n<p>After some quick work last night, I was able to release an early version of a Ruby implementation. Itâ€™s a Rack middleware packaged as a gem that exposes <code>env['console']</code> from which you can create log messages.</p>\n\n<p>It also comes with easy Rails integration: <code>require 'chrome_logger/railtie'</code></p>\n\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://github.com/cookrn/chrome_logger/blob/master/example/config.ru\">an example</a>, read <a href=\"https://github.com/cookrn/chrome_logger\">the code</a>, or just install it!</p>\n\n<p><code>gem install chrome_logger</code></p>\n\n<p>Ryan</p>\n\n</div>\n",
