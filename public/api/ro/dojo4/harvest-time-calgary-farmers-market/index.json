      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>It’s that time of the year when your CSA drops off the last of the eggplant and apples at your door and you start Googling <em>babaghanoush</em> and making cider.</p>\n\n<p>dojo4 recently reconnected with our favorite farmers up North at the <a href=\"http://www.calgaryfarmersmarket.ca/\">Calgary Farmer’s Market</a>.  For a number of years, dojo4 has assisted CFM in maintaining its ExpressionEngine website - one we designed and built for them many moons ago.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve lent a hand with everything from design micro-adjustments to full-page overhauls, such as making their <a href=\"http://www.calgaryfarmersmarket.ca/vendors\">“Explore the Market” map </a>interactive with hover states, tooltips, and light boxes.</p>\n\n<p>On every occasion, it’s been a pleasure working with Mark Franssen; he never seems to get tired of Steve asking “How’s the weather up there?” either. Thanks for being such a great client, CFM!</p>\n\n<p>And while you’re out there perusing blogs, check out <a href=\"http://www.calgaryfarmersmarket.ca/seasons\">CFM’s mouthwatering recipe index for the fall harvest</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/harvest-time-calgary-farmers-market/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"DSC_0761.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/harvest-time-calgary-farmers-market/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"DSC_0799.jpg\" /></p>\n\n\n</div>\n",
