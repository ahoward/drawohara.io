They wanted a new website, and they wanted a new way to engage with their customers.</p>\r\n<p>dojo4 worked with a team of local marketing and design experts, including <a href=\"http://jeffreylarrimore.com\">Jeffrey Larrimore</a>, to produce a comprehensive review of their existing content and design. We led numerous brainstorming sessions to help understand who the market wants to serve and how best to reach those folks. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Then it was to design</strong>. We presented several options and ran through multiple iterations until it was clear that the market's managers were delighted. We were delighted, too! The new design has a vibrant and celebratory feel and offers multiple options for engagement and growth. </p>\r\n<p>As the market completes a move from one physical location to another in Calgary, we continue to support it with fresh content and site features to help people learn about the market's new home. </p>\r\n<p>This has been a very rewarding project&mdash;the folks in Calgary are very interested in making their market's site and online outreach second-to-none. We're proud to be a part of it.</p>",
