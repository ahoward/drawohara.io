And meetings do not need to take a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of shutting yourself in a stuffy room with coworkers or clients, take the conversation outside. Go for a walk- the best meetings happen when there is a change of scenery, fresh air and bodies are moving. Sometimes it actually helps communication not to be face-to-face, but walking side by side, going somewhere. Especially difficult conversations can be easier to have when in motion.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that being in motion lengthens <a href=\"http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/What_is_the_length_of_an_audiences_attention_span_12517.aspx\">our attention spans</a>, but even if people are interested in the meeting and even if they actually care, attention spans still hover around 7-10 minutes for most meetings. So weâ€™ve found that it helps maintain morale and a general sense of good humor to keep meetings short, to-the-point and to move them outside whenever possible.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
