Maiele (my cousin) is taking a different approach to funding her education. <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/s54zfk\">She’s crowd-sourcing it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Its been 15 years since I was at University, and if it wasn’t for <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/collectiveintellect/index.html\">Collective Intellect</a>,  I would still be paying off my student loans.</p>\n\n<p>Of the folks sitting in Dojo4 today, we have 5 people between 7 and 15 years out of university, 8 degrees, 2 of those degrees (both MS Computer Science) see daily use. Funding sources were: Loans, Parents, Scholarships and Canada. 1 person is still paying on their student loans.</p>\n\n<p>I find it encouraging that <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/s54zfk\">Maiele</a> is using <a href=\"http://maiart.weebly.com/\">her skills</a> and finding creative ways to fund her education.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
