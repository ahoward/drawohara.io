Initially, this seemed like a question about sales and how to make them. But really, it’s more a question about public relations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.”</em> - Oscar Wilde</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At dojo4 we’ve relied on word of mouth and referrals for the vast majority of <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/work\">all the clients we’ve ever engaged</a>. Sometimes we go through cycles of doing some sales outreach, but 9 times out of 10, no matter how much effort we put into making sales, the contracts we end up engaging are with people that come through our door because they’ve heard of us from a colleague or because we’ve worked together, in some way or another, in the past. In other words, classic advertising and marketing don’t seem to make much of a difference for us.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“People do not buy goods and services. They buy relations, stories and magic.”</em> -Seth Godin</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My suspicion is that it’s often a constellation of things that end up connecting us with clients. And, somehow it’s worked because, here we are, still in business and going strong after many years. Here are a few of the factors that I think have been helpful, that I suggested to my fellow founder who had gotten in touch:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Be vocal! <a href=\"https://unreasonable.is/author/corey-kohn/\">Publish articles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bitballoon.com/blog/2014/03/27/ara-t-howard-on-static-sites-dynamic-content-and-creativity\">do</a> <a href=\"https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/094-rr-robust-ruby-with-ara-t-howard\">podcasts</a> and <a href=\"http://ugurus.com/estimate-the-quality-of-a-developer-by-the-size-of-their-bin-directory-interview-with-ara-howard-of-dojo4-ugurus-comblogestimate-the-quality-of-a-developer-by-the-size-of-their-bin-directory-intervie\">videos</a>, post <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog\">blogs</a> and <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/play/within40feet\">images</a>, take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06v2Imhm5aQ\">speaking</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go6qly-65EY\">engagements</a>, participate in <a href=\"https://confreaks.tv/presenters/jeremy-hinegardner\">conferences</a> and workshops, <a href=\"http://rubyquiz.com/quiz67.html\">provoke others</a> to <a href=\"https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/solving-ara-howard-s-metakoans\">write about you</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_29787457/after-midnight-new-boulder-co-working-space-caters\">get in the news</a> <a href=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_30803106/boulder-businesses-all-showing-image-inclusiveness\">when you can</a>, make <a href=\"https://github.com/copiousfreetime\">open</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/spikex\">source</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/ahoward\">contributions</a>, <a href=\"http://orapinmarketing.com/inspired-impact-dojo4/\">etc</a>.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://ugurus.com/human-relationships-over-revenue-interview-with-corey-kohn-of-dojo4\">Speak</a> <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/family-friendly-workplace-manifesto\">out</a> about what <a href=\"https://dev.to/iphreaks/137-ips-program-like-you-give-a-damn-with-ara-t-howard-at-rails-remote-conf-2015\">you’re passionate about</a>, whether or not it directly relates to your work.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Publicize others that you think are doing cool shit - products, other companies and organizations, individuals - and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=%40dojo4&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">they will return the favor</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Donate your time, energy and money strategically - do only things you are excited about and prioritize those things that will give you <a href=\"http://igniteboulder.com/sponsors\">visibility</a>, if that’s what you’re looking for.</li>\n  <li>Never undersell yourself - it <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/deck\">helps clients understand  your value</a>, even before they start working with you.

Do be <a href=\"http://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/\">creative</a>, bold and genuine, and the right clients will find you.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“Next to doing the right thing, the most important thing is to let people know you are doing the right thing.”</em> - John D.

A dazzle of zebras dazzles, indeed!</p>\n\n<p>The Zebras that were called together at <a href=\"https://www.zebrasunite.com/dazzlecon/\">DazzleCon</a> are a special breed. We are founders, investors and participants in companies that are both <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebrasfix-c467e55f9d96\">black and white: they are profitable and improve society</a> and don’t sacrifice one for the other. We are playing a different game than the often predatory, exploitative, short-sighted, narrow and repetitive sport that has been exemplified by the conventional startup funding model’s exclusive preference for unicorn <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/magazine/wp-content/images/18-10/mf_thinkgeek_f.jpg\">meat</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"(https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebrasfix-c467e55f9d96)\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/zebras-get-down-to-business-dazzlecon17/assets/c.png' alt=\"Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 12.17.50 PM copy.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Back in 2016, this gathering was just a glimmer in the eye of the <a href=\"https://www.zebrasunite.com/our-story\">authors of this sentence</a>: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/sex-startups-53f2f63ded49\">“Startups, like the male anatomy, are designed for liquidity events.”</a> That sentence opened an article that expressed what many of us had known, but may or may not have fully acknowledged, for years: the startup ecosystem is rigged. Who participates in, cultivates, funds and benefits from this ecosystem is dictated by the mostly <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/09/29/group-of-white-men-in-patagonia-vests-confused-for-vc-fund-raise-500-million/\">white, patriarchal hegemony</a> that engendered it. The startup world is primarily populated by people who are most likely to identify as being economically-advantaged, white and male. And the startup business model and network that makes it possible is characterized by a high level of competition, exploitation of its workers and users, emphasis on profit at all costs and generally predatory business practices. As Zebras, we are designing and building businesses that are aimed at solving real-world problems through collaboration, mutualism, and inclusive thinking that regenerates our communities, our economies, our environment, and our families. Our businesses aren’t just creating social impact in what we’re doing, but how we’re doing it.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/zebras-get-down-to-business-dazzlecon17/assets/d.jpeg' alt=\"IMG_5624.JPG\" /></p>\n\n<p>DazzleCon made a great effort in reflecting this in who was there and what we talked about. Without a doubt, <a href=\"https://www.feld.com/archives/2017/11/zebras-uniting-dazzlecon.html\">DazzleCon was a business conference</a>. But it was a conference for business as Zebras practice it. It was a conference for business as we aspire for the world to practice it. Clues to this were scattered throughout: the opening acknowledgement of being on the ancestral lands of the native peoples of the area, the childcare offered during the whole the program, <a href=\"https://burginmathews.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/wendell-berry.jpg?w=863\">Wendell Berry</a>’s “<a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/wendell-e-berry-lecture\">It All Turns On Affection</a>” and Bahá’í Assembly’s “<a href=\"http://www.bahai.org/documents/nsa-usa/two-wings-bird\">Two Wings of a Bird</a>” tucked into the swag bag. This was the first such conference, <a href=\"https://www.zebrasunite.com/our-story\">emerging out of the the overwhelming response to the first few articles posted by the founders of the gathering</a>, and as such, it had that feeling of intimacy, that we can make it what we want by being who we are.</p>\n\n<p>The enthusiasm and deep networks of the founders, the inspiring <a href=\"http://www.marazepeda.com/\">Mara Zepeda</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aniyiawilliams.com/\">Aniyia Williams</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sphaera.world/astrid/\">Astrid Scholz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jennyanything.com/\">Jennifer Brandel</a>, was heartfelt and apparent. Unfortunately that gusto expressed itself in a schedule that was too packed with speakers talking at attendees from a stage. In this way, the conference missed the opportunity to embody in its design the abundant energy that was gathered with facilitation tools that create emergent connections and actions like those offered organizations like the <a href=\"http://www.artofhosting.org/\">Art of Hosting</a> and <a href=\"https://social-labs.org/toolkits/\">Social Labs</a>. The feeling of the conference as great, but the <a href=\"https://goodgoodwork.io/5-shapes-training-without-boss/\">shape</a> of this first one was somewhat misconceived. However, this gave me the opportunity to forge my own path with some of the enormously compelling people that I met there. The reality that how we do business is the nexus of our impact was beautifully manifested in the organizations built by so many of the people I got a chance to connect with there, like <a href=\"http://tinsel.me/\">Tinsel</a>, <a href=\"http://sidedooraccess.com/\">Side Door</a>, <a href=\"https://namastream.com/\">Namastream</a>, <a href=\"https://goodgoodwork.io/\">Good Good Work</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smithandconnors.com/\">Smith and Connors</a>, to name a few. And that’s why I was there: to survey and wander through this landscape of people and companies that are making real and deep positive change by the way they are doing business. The Zebra ethos is in dojo4’s DNA- I went to share who we are, to connect and to learn. And that’s exactly what happened.</p>\n\n<p>In a post-conference email exchange of feedback, <a href=\"http://www.marazepeda.com/\">Mara Zepeda</a> expressed that her hope for the future of these gatherings is that we would <em>party</em> more together. I share her sentiment that Zebras can actually change the course of the history of business and the problems it solves with our playful energy. I have no doubt that we will find lots of ways to play together and am looking forward it it!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

We’ve found that we do our best work when it engages real problems, when we are helping create <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/program-like-you-give-a-damn\">a world where no one is limited by their circumstance</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The understanding that effective social impact works to create a world where no one is limited by their circumstance, is one that we gained from <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/wanted-gnu-unreasonable-nerds\">a conversation</a> with <a href=\"https://unreasonablegroup.com/\">Unreasonable</a> co-founder <a href=\"http://danielepstein.me/\">Daniel Epstein</a>. This definition made the most sense to us because it takes the vague aphorism of ‘making the world a better place’ and gives it definition and illuminates the potential that exists for this aspirational ‘better world’ if its inhabitants were actually free from the limitations of their circumstances to be able to do something improve it. This definition also acknowledges the deep and nuanced complexity of doing good in this world.</p>\n\n<p>However, my initial and naive approach externalized the responsibility of what limiting the circumstances of our lives actually means. I thought that running a social impact organization was as simple as working with like-minded clients that are doing ‘impactful’ work. We would build technology for companies that addressed ‘real problems’ such as social injustice, environmental degradation, gender inequality, poverty and hunger. And vicariously we would be creating impact. But… it’s not that easy.</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, creating impact isn’t something that others can do for you, even if you are supporting their impactful work. We’ve been lucky to work with <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/work\">clients</a> that are are powerhouses in the impact they make, but just writing code for them doesn’t mean that we are creating impact ourselves. It has to go deeper than that.</p>\n\n<p>One of <a href=\"http://orapinmarketing.com/inspired-impact-dojo4/\">our biggest challenges</a> has been maintaining clarity about what impact means and sticking with it. It’s not simple. We’ve learned that just because a client was doing good work, that does not mean that we were necessarily a good fit for one another and should necessarily work together. Other times what looks like positive impact might not actually be that straightforward: as technologists we often have the access to see that what might look good from the outside might not actually be doing much good once you look under the hood into the technology or business practices. Or sometimes there’s just a difference in approach for which we could not provide the best support. Also, our idea of working exclusively with ‘impact clients’ meant that we were counting out the possibility of working collaboratively with more conventional clients to make their products more impactful.</p>\n\n<p>We realized that, for us, impact really means doing purposeful work, whether that be technically, culturally, socially, environmentally or personally purposeful. Doing purposeful work means that we are enlivened and inspired by what we’re doing and bring that to our relationships with our clients and each other. It means creating trusting relationships that allow good technology and design to inform the impact that companies and their products can create. It means sticking to our gut feelings, not being simplistic about ideology, and always practicing rigor in our craft. It means we can never be lazy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.evolveandascend.com/2017/01/31/these-10-quotes-by-chogyam-trungpa-rinpoche-cut-through-spiritual-b-s/\">Chögyam Trungpa</a> said it, pointedly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You don’t have to rush out to become the mayor of your city or the president of the United States in order to help others, but you can begin with your relatives and friends and the people around you. In fact, you can start with yourself. The important point is to realize that you are never off duty.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For dojo4 this has meant starting with the seed of our own company and building a place that supports each of us in our own lives. It’s meant building an environment that aims to fosters honesty, kindness toward ourselves and others, and supports good work and good fun. It might seem like a small impact to simply create this within our own organization, but it is a seed. If every small company was able to provide this kind of friendliness internally and it its community, that would have a huge impact on people and populations. And this seed within our individual lives, allows for greater real potential for large scale impact. One way to say it is that we can’t effectively help others until we can help ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>This is something that any organization can do. Any business can be an impact company - a hardware store, a insurance brokerage, a janitorial service business, an advertising agency, etc. We can all aspire to create a world where no one is limited by their circumstance, but to do that we have to think close to home and inclusively about what that means. We can all work to address the world’s many and real problems, but in order to do that effectively, we have to start with ourselves. We can’t let ourselves off the hook: have to look at and help ourselves and create companies that are genuinely engaged, kind and joyful places before we can be any help to others. That’s not a simple or easy thing to do, but if we can do it, the effect is truly impactful.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

I thought that if a company was structured a certain way and created a scaffolding of certain processes, that would allow a culture to be built based on those structures. I thought that the <em>personality</em> of a business (what we usually call <em>culture</em>) could be shaped by it’s operations. While this may, in some cases, be partially true, I’ve found that it’s much more of a two way street- and more often than not, it’s the other way around. More often than not, it is useful and prudent to let culture dictate operations. Let <em>nature</em> (culture) set the ground for <em>nurture</em> (operations) and both will thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not there is conscious effort dedicated to cultivating a company culture, every organization has one. Every organization has its own personality, and just like a human being, often that personality is there from day one. The conditions of a company’s birth - its founders, its funding, its physical environment, its initial employees - often set a blueprint for that company’s culture that can endure for its lifetime.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/for-a-smoother-ride-let-culture-drive-and-put-operations-in-shotgun/assets/c.png' alt=\"i-bet-you-two-are-excited-to-find-out-what-29875995.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>A company’s personality traits can come in all shapes and sizes. For example, each organization likely falls on one side or another of many of these types of traits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>risk-friendly vs. risk-averse</li>\n  <li>chaotic vs. orderly</li>\n  <li>transparent vs. private</li>\n  <li>goofy vs. serious</li>\n  <li>frenetic &amp; fast vs. steady &amp; slow</li>\n  <li>imaginative vs. practical</li>\n  <li>adventurous vs. cautious</li>\n  <li>intuition-based vs. data-based</li>\n  <li>democratic vs. monarchical</li>\n  <li>collaborative vs. competitive</li>\n  <li>heart-biased vs. mind-biased</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>None of these are necessarily better than the other, but it’s good to be honest about who and what your company is so that you can own that and use it rather than be trampled by it. You have to be able to build your operations to leverage the strengths of your culture rather than minimizing them or working against them. It’s possible to power your operations with your culture rather than having them work against each other.</p>\n\n<p>For a long time I tried to fit our operations around a culture that was not ours. I thought that by doing our operations a certain way, that would nudge our culture more in line with what I imagined a successful company culture should be. These are the things I thought we should be doing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have more regular, standing meetings in order to get our internal communications into a predictable mold</li>\n  <li>have polished proposals to woo potential clients</li>\n  <li>have project managers to keep us on track and to relate to clients instead of our developers and designers being in touch with them directly</li>\n  <li>have lots of employees that acted like employees and generally worked at the office between certain times</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As it turns out, we’re an unruly bunch. This is us (or at least one version of us):</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/for-a-smoother-ride-let-culture-drive-and-put-operations-in-shotgun/assets/d.png' alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-03-05 at 4.24.59 PM.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>It turns out that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>we can’t have regular meetings</li>\n  <li>we can’t produce polished proposals</li>\n  <li>we can’t work with project managers</li>\n  <li>we can’t have employees at all</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is all part of a culture that was baked into our company from the very beginning. We attracted a combination of people that can’t have regular meetings that are more than 5 min long. We aren’t interested in creating anything more than bullet points in an email as a client proposal. We can pretty much manage ourselves. None of us do well as employees, nor do we want to have jobs.</p>\n\n<p>And we’ve been in business now for 8+ years and going strong, because or despite all of this. So something must be working! I tried to make us more conventional but that wasn’t going to fly and would have probably killed our business if I had really pushed it. Instead I found operations that supported the culture we have, cultivated that culture further and used it rather than working against it.</p>\n\n<p>We found out that business at dojo4 thrives when our operations are in line with our culture, and that means they need to be lightweight, adaptable, informal, transparent, asynchronous, and automated. Here are some practical examples of some of those operations:</p>\n\n<p><strong>status emails</strong>\nAt dojo4, whether we are working in the office or some somewhere else, first thing each day (whatever that means to each of us) we send an email to status@, to check in with each other and share info on what we are doing and when. This allows us to easily coordinate with each other, avoid unnecessary meetings, and get by without extraneous management.</p>\n\n<p><strong>transparent accounting</strong>\nTrust is really important to us.\nSo we built a system for keeping all our passwords and credentials and share access to ALL (e.g. all bank logins, credit card #s, etc.) of that with anyone who works with us. This allows us to each take ownership of our work and the company, and the accountability that comes with that. It also serves to remind us that trust and transparency some of our core tenets, and as such, we don’t f*** around.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/for-a-smoother-ride-let-culture-drive-and-put-operations-in-shotgun/assets/e.jpeg' alt=\"dontfuckaround.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>frequent invoicing</strong>\nBy invoicing often, it cuts down on the need to micromanage projects (it’s quick feedback loop for our clients) and it allows us to pay our people often. It it’s another tool to support project management without project managers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>noon standups</strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://unreasonable.is/52-questions-get-heart-team-make-meetings-matter/\">Friday standups</a> / lunch</strong>\nAlthough we have no internal interest in having regular work-related meetings, we have a 1-5 min “standup” meeting every day at noon to check-in, in-person or by video. We also have a non-work standup for dojo4 workers and friends every Friday, to understand ourselves &amp; each other better. \nThese meetings support cadence, communication and team cohesion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>worker-owned structure</strong>\ndojo4 always seemed to behaved like a co-operative. In March 2017, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/on-the-lip-of-shared-ownership-dojo4-becomes-a-co-op-series-number-4\">we finally made it official</a> and became a LCA (Limited Cooperative Association). \nOur company now operates entirely as co-operative.</p>\n\n<p>Another pretty example of the marriage of operations and culture and how they support each other is our <a href=\"http://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/\">Little Handbook for Sturdy Startups</a>. Like “meetings don’t have to look like meetings” and “make sanity #1”. \n<img src='/ro/dojo4/for-a-smoother-ride-let-culture-drive-and-put-operations-in-shotgun/assets/f.jpeg' alt=\"sanity.jpg\" /> \n<img src='/ro/dojo4/for-a-smoother-ride-let-culture-drive-and-put-operations-in-shotgun/assets/g.jpeg' alt=\"meetings.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Like each person, each company has a unique personality. And each personality has something to offer- build your company to leverage that personality, and go far!</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",

      "published_at": "2018-09-04 23:03:32 UTC",
      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><img src='/ro/dojo4/what-is-impact-anyway/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"impact.jpg\" /> \nA few years ago, we decided we wanted dojo4 to be an “impact organization.” We wanted to commit ourselves to doing work that inspires us, feels important and is truly helpful to the world around us. It felt like the best way to do that was to organize ourselves around work that could be put under the umbrella of “impact.” We define impactful work on our <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/about\">website</a> this way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>We understand impact organizations to be those that use ingenuity to actively help people and our environment, by providing solutions to real problems. We’ve found that we do our best work when it engages real problems, when we are helping create a world where no one is limited by their circumstance.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That was years ago. And our understanding of what it means to do meaningful and impactful work has evolved during that time.</p>\n\n<p>This week we were honored <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/directory/dojo4\">again</a> as being Best For The World in the Changemakers category. That means that, along with 203 companies in 66 different industries from around the world, we are being recognized for making the most positive improvement on our overall impact, based on the <a href=\"https://bimpactassessment.net/\">independent, comprehensive assessment</a> administered by the nonprofit <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/about-b-lab\">B Lab</a>.  It’s lovely to have have our efforts acknowledged in this way and to be in the company of <a href=\"http://www.bthechange.com\">so many extraordinary companies</a> doing the hard work of improving this world of ours. And, for me, it raises the question again: what is this thing we call “impact?”</p>\n\n<p>A colloquial definition of impact is to have a strong effect on someone or something. The contemporary business and investment usage of the term adds to that by implying a positive value to that impact. Impact = doing good. The implication is that a business can create a strong positive effect on people’s lives. As the good people at the <a href=\"https://unreasonablegroup.com/about/\">Unreasonable Group</a> put it, it’s about using business to provide solutions to the “<a href=\"https://unreasonable.is/\">big f**ckin problems</a>.” Those problems are things like environmental degradation, poverty and wealth disparity, hunger and lack of clean water, avoidable illness, human rights, access to education and opportunity, and violent conflict. And those problems can also be things like depression, loneliness, and meaningless.</p>\n\n<p>But impact is complex, and the understanding of what good work is has deepened for many of us at dojo4, to include not just creating a work product that genuinely helps people and our environment. Sometimes, more immediately, it is simply work that supports a sense of joyful capacity, community engagement, wholeheartedly applied skill and fruitful collaboration. There’s no question in my mind that the best use of business is to solve problems like homelessness, for instance. But if the company that is building a product / service to alleviate that problem is a dysfunctional, mismanaged, disheartened workplace, the positive impact of the product / service is not sustainable. Furthermore, harm is being created in the very process of trying to generate positive impact. Kindness toward yourself is what allows you to be truly kind to others. Similarly, companies have to take care of their own people, structure and environment before they can genuinely do good with their business.</p>\n\n<p>At dojo4 we continue to chose to work with <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/work\">mission-driven clients</a> that are committed to creating benefit in many of the impact categories like the ones outlined in the B Corp Assessment. But we’ve also found that one of the ways that we can create the most benefit is to turn our minds and energy toward the immediate impact that our work creates on ourselves and the people around us. Regardless of our current client roster and work projects, we focus on creating impact with the work environment, relationships and attitudes we cultivate. I believe that although (or maybe because?) we are a small company, we have a substantial positive impact on our community, our clients and our own experience, because we’ve completely invested ourselves in making a extraordinary space that we all like to work in, a space and deep relationships that are inclusive and welcoming, and challenge us to be ever more inclusive and welcoming. We still have a long way to go, but we are fervently committed to creating impact by building a business based trust and generosity.</p>\n\n<p>I am impressed and glad that we have made measurable gains in our impact on Environment, Customers, Governance, and Community. But I am most proud that we have made what I believe is truly positive impact on our own lives, the lives of our families, our clients and our community. I’m not sure how to measure joy but I’m sure that it is integral to any true impact, and I’m sure that it is scalable and ripples outwards in significant and influential ways.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/what-is-impact-anyway/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"my-question-is-are-we-making-an-impact-new-yorker-cartoon_u-l-pgqrml0.jpg\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

No judgement on either type, but sometimes you need to make it easier to digest.</p>\n\n<p>Putting rows and columns of data into a format the helps people understand “what it’s all about” is usually called <em>data visualization</em>.  There a lots of tools out there to create charts and graphics from spreadsheets - including ones built in to Excel or Google Sheets.  Sometimes you need something more robust though - and the best tool for the job is <a href=\"http://d3js.org\">D3</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Case in point: dojo4 recently finished a job for <a href=\"https://350.org\">350.org</a> - an organization focused on reducing fossil fuels and moving to 100% renewable energy sources.  We used the concept of a chord diagram to represent the efforts of several groups and organizations targeting international banks that fund fossil fuel projects around the world.  The color coding gives a quick overview on the groups and their particular fossil fuel focus.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/data-visualization-with-google-sheets-and-d3--js/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"350-chord-diagram-base.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Users can hover over an organization and see which banks they are targeting:\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/data-visualization-with-google-sheets-and-d3--js/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"350-d3-chord-diagram-hover1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Or hover over a bank and see which groups are targeting that specific bank.\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/data-visualization-with-google-sheets-and-d3--js/assets/d.jpeg' alt=\"350-d3-chord-diagram-hover2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><sup><em>(note that the names of banks and organizations have been removed for privacy)</em></sup></p>\n\n<p>This chord diagram was dynamically generated from a shared Google Sheet using Google App Script and custom Javascript attached to the Sheet.  This self-contained relationship helps to make sure the source data and the code to generate the chart don’t lose their relationship, and any updates to the shared sheet will automatically update the chart.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I enjoyed working with dojo4. The team really wanted to understand how a visualization of my data would be valuable and they seem to work from there. I now have an accessible and engaging graphic that tells a story of where there are gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for more coordination. I appreciated how they took the time to learn my organization’s aesthetics and worked to match our style.</em>    –Senior Global Analyst, <a href=\"https://350.org/\">350.org</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.jeanniephan.com/\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/generosity-is-an-advantage/assets/b.jpeg' alt=\"JeanniePhan-boxes.jpg\" /> </a></p>\n\n<p>Looking for a strategic advantage for your organization this year? A way to set your company aside, to differentiate it from the rest? To find that kind of success, consider further cultivating <strong>generosity</strong> as a core component of your business.</p>\n\n<p>What does that mean, in practical terms? As we know, generosity is the inclination to give without any expectation of return, to be open-handed and hearted, to be unselfish, unstingy, broadminded and inviting. As a company, that can look a lot of different ways. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Generosity with employees - <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/bigger-paychecks-better-impact\">Pay more.</a> Offer substantive benefits. Open an <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/on-the-lip-of-shared-ownership-dojo4-becomes-a-co-op-series-number-1\">option to ownership</a>. Prioritize <a href=\"https://bthechange.com/4-companies-share-their-paths-to-great-governance-16fa1de6d3d5\">transparency</a>.</li>\n  <li>Generosity with customers - Offer them more than they expect. Allow them into your process.</li>\n  <li>Generosity with <a href=\"https://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/embrace-the-competition/\">competitors</a> - Share business and market tips. Send over customers that are better suited to them. Collaborate.</li>\n  <li>Generosity with <a href=\"https://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/call-on-community/\">community</a> - Contribute to the local culture and society with time, money, space, events, volunteers, etc.</li>\n  <li>Generosity with self - Prioritize the health, <a href=\"https://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/make-sanity-number-1/\">sanity</a> and wellbeing of yourself and the internal operations of the company. <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/grief-as-an-entrepreneurial-asset\">Meet yourself where you are</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These expressions of generosity may simply seem like the right thing to do. No doubt that’s true, but they also provide a real and meaningful advantage in navigating the business landscape. While generosity doesn’t expect anything in return, it does generate a <a href=\"https://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/be-generous/\">wheel of wealth</a> in the form of “what comes around, go around.” And this cycle provides both measurable and untold value. Because it’s a differentiator and indicator of integrity, generosity attracts both good employees and good clients. In that way generosity reliably contributes to organizational longevity and sustained profits.</p>\n\n<p>These profits may be financial or represent other kinds of capital. For instance, practicing generosity may generate value reflected in some or all of these ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the strength and wealth of the local economy,</li>\n  <li>the number of families and individuals that are supported by the business,</li>\n  <li>the degree of cultural vibrancy that is supported by the business,</li>\n  <li>the intellectual, technical, environmental or social innovation and advancement cultivated by the business,</li>\n  <li>the goodwill and social capital generated by the business.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Generosity can take a lot of different forms and look a lot of different ways, but it’s a one-size-fits-all method for giving your business a strategic advantage. Magnanimity will boost your business by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>attracting and retaining stellar employees,</li>\n  <li>cultivating collaborative partnerships and knowledge-building with competitors,</li>\n  <li>magnetizing and preserving lasting relationships with clients and customers,</li>\n  <li>supporting internal and personal resilience,</li>\n  <li>inviting various expressions of capitalization and value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No matter how much or how little it may feel there is to go around, there is always some way to give. There is no downside to creating wealth in that way. And, in any case, regardless of the business benefits associated with generosity, cultivating it as a core tenant of a company will inevitably <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15964\">increase happiness</a>. You can’t go wrong with that.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Despite that purely mercenary consumerist capitalism still rules the roost of business, the ideas of using <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/about-b-corps\">business as a force for good</a> and <a href=\"https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/credo\">conscious capitalism</a> seem now to have fully entered the popular mind stream.</p>\n\n<p>National and international organizations (and their associated events) like <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/\">B Lab</a>, <a href=\"https://consciouscompanymedia.com/\">Conscious Company Media</a>, <a href=\"https://socialcapitalmarkets.net/\">Social Capital Markets</a>, <a href=\"http://\">Social Venture Network</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.zebrasunite.com/\">Zebra</a> movement have for years, if not decades, been working to bolster this movement. They have also been integral to bringing the conversation about conscious business into the mainstream.  (Also see <a href=\"https://consciouscompanymedia.com/sustainable-business/10-conscious-business-industry-groups-consider-joining/\">this list</a> of industry groups with similar missions.)</p>\n\n<p>A few themes are pushing to the forefront of this conversation that are both encouraging and demanding. These are threads that ran throughout the discussions and presentations many of the gatherings that I was at over the last few years: <a href=\"https://www.zebrasunite.com/attend-dazzlecon-17\">DazzleCon</a> in 2017, the annual <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/2019-champions-retreat\">B Corp Champions Retreat</a>, and the recent the <a href=\"https://consciouscompanyleadersforum.com/\">Conscious Leaders Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://bthechange.com/we-the-change-women-together-envision-a-better-earth-through-better-business-8c9524777a14\">BCEO Women’s gathering</a> of female B Corp founders and CEOs. Likely, these topics are now also points of focus at every other gathering of this type.  They are clusters of attention that are gaining strength and it’s become ever more clear that we can’t have the conversation about doing well by doing good in business without talking about them:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Equity, inclusion and diversity.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Self-care and mindfulness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Love.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. The how, not the what.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s break ‘em down a little, with some resources to learn more, if you are so inclined…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Equity, Inclusion and Diversity</strong>\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/4-critical-tools-for-creating-benefit-through-biz/assets/66966.jpg' alt=\"young-lando-diversity.jpg\" /> If we are going to improve the state of the world, it’s becoming ever more clear that generative change cannot happen with a narrow group of people nor a narrow frame of mind. Limited and disproportional inclusion can only lead to limited and disproportional benefit. Broadening our understanding of identity and access has become fundamental to the movement to use business to drive that change. Emphasis on <a href=\"https://consciouscompanymedia.com/workplace-culture/3-lessons-on-advancing-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace/\">deepening our awareness</a> of entrenched and toxic exclusivity, inequity and homogeneity is fueling a greater consciousness of what is possible when more and varied perspectives are included. Gatherings like <a href=\"https://consciouscompanymedia.com/spectrum/\">Spectrum</a> are heralding the powerful wave of change that emerges from diverse experiences, identities, geographies, abilities and perspectives. Providing resources for effective <a href=\"https://bcorporation.net/for-b-corps/inclusive-economy-challenge\">inclusiveness has become a top priority</a> for B Lab. The Zebra movement is focused on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebras-lets-get-in-formation-fdcbc72fec4a\">re-appropriating the system</a> to be something more and to be something different kinds of entrepreneurs actually want to participate in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Self-Care and Mindfulness</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.behance.net/oritoor\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/4-critical-tools-for-creating-benefit-through-biz/assets/67025.jpg' alt=\"green-meditator - www.behancenet-oritoor.jpg\" /></a> We’re learning that for real change to happen it has to be internalized.  Anxiety, franticness, self-aggression, depression and guilt are not sustainable fuel for positive change. As the demands of a speedy, relentless world take their toll on our bodies and psyches, and our societies and environment need all the help they can get, the stakes have become higher. It is ever more recognized that any inclination to use business to offer that help to the world must be supported by sane minds and healthy bodies. Caring for ourselves is integral to being effective entrepreneurs and changemakers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.impactfounder.com/\">Impact Founder</a>, the <a href=\"https://soultour.com/sou\">School of Upliftment</a>, <a href=\"https://siyli.org/\">Search Inside Yourself</a> and <a href=\"http://awakeatwork.net/\">Awake at Work</a> are just a few of countless organizations that are addressing this need and this opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The jury is in: self-care and awareness, in its various forms such as meditation, yoga, time in nature, saying no, etc. are integral priorities for the most potent work to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Love</strong>\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/4-critical-tools-for-creating-benefit-through-biz/assets/66962.jpg' alt=\"Love-is-the-Answer,medium_large.1431659585.jpg\" /> Love has entered the language of mainstream business management. Elderly, white and sometimes even politically conservative male CEOs are getting up in front large audiences to talk about love being the mainstay of the success of their multinational companies. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP9QF_lBOyA\">Ray Anderson</a>, the famed founder of <a href=\"https://www.interface.com/US/en-US/homepage\">Interface Inc.</a> carpet, may have been one of the first to break the modern seal on imbuing the power of business with sentimentality (along with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/James-A.-Autry/e/B001IYZFQG\">James Autry’s earlier books</a> on biz leadership as service). And <a href=\"https://ileadwithlove.org/bob-chapman-2018\">Bob Chapman</a>, CEO of the equipment and engineering conglomerate <a href=\"https://www.barrywehmiller.com/\">Barry Wehmiller</a>, is now coming on strong. His approach may be based in a Reagan-era paternalism, but the message that comes through in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Matters-Extraordinary-Caring-People/dp/1591847796\">his writing</a> is unequivocal in its emphasis on the need for love and caring to be the foundation of any successful business. Similarly, the first new rule of business in <a href=\"http://rajsisodia.com/\">Raj Sisodia</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.firmsofendearment.com/\"><em>Firms of Endearment</em></a> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Build a high-performance business on love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Mary Powell, CEO of Green Mountain Energy, who has massively grown the company’s revenues, attributes a large part of her company’s success to <a href=\"https://greenmountainpower.com/news/gmps-mary-powell-list-world-changing-women/\">“leading with love.”</a></p>\n\n<p>The understanding is that the impact of a company is directly predicated on the love and care that its employees are afforded in their work. If employees feel valued and truly cared for, they will not only develop the talents and gifts that contributed to a well-resourced, successful company, but will be happier, more fulfilled human beings with more to offer their relationships and the world. This approach to conscious business reasons that we can <a href=\"https://www.trulyhumanleadership.com/?page_id=36\">change the world one job at a time</a>, with love.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The How, Not The What</strong>\n<a href=\"https://consciouscompanymedia.com/the-new-economy/tru-colors-brewery-impact-investing/\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/4-critical-tools-for-creating-benefit-through-biz/assets/67041.jpg' alt=\"TRU-Colors_Photo-by-Will-Page-Photography-1.jpg\" /></a> The questions of what companies should do to create change in the world and what they can do to do good are changing. The questions are now <em>how</em> do we create change in the world and <em>how</em> do we do good? We are seeing increasingly compelling instances of the purpose behind mission-driven companies being expressed in how they do business. A beautiful example of this is <a href=\"https://trucolors.co/\">TRU Colors brewery</a>. TRU Colors is North Carolina brewery staffed by local, often rival, gang members. The mission of the company is to eliminate gang-related gun violence in area. This mission is accomplished by offering gang members rewarding employment alongside people who have been their adversaries in the community. Training and group facilitation is provided as part of the professional training for employees. Thus far the gang-related violence has been significantly reduced in the community since the brewery started hiring gang members. TRU Colors’ economic product is beer, but how and by who that beer is produced is where their impact lies.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a company like <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/\">Warby Parker</a> is creating impact not by selling eyeglasses, but by <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/how-our-glasses-are-made\">producing them</a> in a sustainable, non-toxic way and by having integrated a <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/buy-a-pair-give-a-pair\">Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program</a> into their business model. My business <a href=\"https://dojo4.com/\">dojo4</a> creates our most powerful impact not only through the code we write for clients but by providing our members with an engaged livelihood that supports not only their families but their passions, and by creating and serving our community.</p>\n\n<p>There are more and more examples that any company can be used to do good in the world. An <a href=\"https://www.cotopaxi.com/pages/gear-for-good\">outdoor apparel company</a> can be based on “improving the human condition” and impactful in making “<a href=\"https://www.cotopaxi.com/pages/impact-report\">meaningful strides toward reducing global poverty</a>.” And this is potent it means that <em>any</em> company can create impact. We have <a href=\"https://dojo4.com/work\">clients</a> like <a href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/\">Brass Taxes</a> and <a href=\"https://inkind.com/\">InKind</a> who are creating significant positive impact and humanizing the way business is done through providing everything from <a href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/\">tax services</a> to <a href=\"https://www.inkind.com/\">restaurant financing</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As we work to co-opt business as a way to create benefit, we’re learning how to do it better. Inclusion, self-care, love and how we do it will be the supports that are going to make it happen.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
