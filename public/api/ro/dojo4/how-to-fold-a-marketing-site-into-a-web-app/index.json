Joanna and Mark first worked on massaging the content from the marketing site into the web app's landing page, using wireframes to place content into discrete buckets. Their clear copy explains how easy it is for folks to use InspirePay to start taking payments.</p>\n\n<p>Next,&#160;<a href=\"/#anthony\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Dimitre</a>, resident design wizard at dojo4, turned the content map into an elegant, well-designed web page:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl mrl\">\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/how-to-fold-a-marketing-site-into-a-web-app/assets/inspirepay-new-design.png' title=\"Inspirepay New Design\" alt=\"Inspirepay New Design\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" />\n<figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\" style=\"text-align:center;\">The redesigned page describes the product and instructs the user</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>With page designs in hand we moved into implementation. In this case that meant replacing a siloed instance of Wordpress with static pages in the application itself. Serving marketing content from the same container as InspirePay's payment processing application required dojo4 to ensure all assets and 3rd-party embeds were transmitted securely across https. We also integrated the application's authentication into the static page.</p>\n<p>Now from the landing page alone, visitors can learn about the product, get a sense of how it works, and sign up to use it. One-stop shopping!</p>\n\n<p>See for yourself: <a href=\"https://inspirepay.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://inspirepay.com</a>.</p>\n\n</div>",
