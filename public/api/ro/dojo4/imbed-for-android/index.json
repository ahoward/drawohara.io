The open source code that resulted from building several native apps that included web content was the <a href=\"https://github.com/Imbed\">Imbed project</a>. We released the <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/announcing-imbed-the-best-way-to-use-web-content-in-an-i-os-app\">iOS version first</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to be a starting point for what we think is the best way to incorporate web content into a native app - using native code. In iOS that means writing Objective-C to use a UIWebView and in Android that means writing Java to use a WebView. Yes, this requires that you know enough about iOS/Objective-C and Android/Java to write your own native functions when you want to use device features, but that means being able to follow Apple &amp; Google’s directions exactly and not depend on a third party to support a new feature and support it without bugs of its own.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I’ve been diving deeper into Android research and have created the <a href=\"https://github.com/imbed/android\">Android version of Imbed</a>. In addition to providing a nice starting point for including web content, the example html code demonstrates some javascript limitations in the webview and provides built-in support for the all-important back button on Android phones when you click a link that needs opening in Chrome vs in the web content within your app.</p>\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/imbed/android\">Android version</a> and let me know your thoughts on twitter!</p>\n\n<p>As always, pull requests welcome :)</p>\n\n</div>\n",
