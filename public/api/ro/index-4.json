      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><img src=\"assets/productivity.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n<p>How does one stay productive in such a busy world? A world where people wake up and check their Facebook statuses as soon as their alarm goes off. “Must let folks know I’m awake—–”. Or in a world where you wear several different hats (parent, sibling, friend, employee, business owner, feeder of dog, etc). It can get confusing and also overwhelming. Do you ever feel like there’s not enough time in the day or like you just can’t get anything done? Here are some simple tips to help you de-clutter the outside world, so you can streamline and be more productive at what you do best.</p>\n\n<p>But first, let me update my Facebook status……. just kidding.</p>\n\n<p>REDUCE YOUR CLUTTER: How can you think in a crowded space? You can’t! There’s no space for energy to flow in and out of your life. And so it gets caught, in between stacks of papers or piles of who knows what or things you plan on going through later. That time is now. Sound like too daunting of a task for you? Break it up into sections and work on small parts towards a larger goal. Schedule time to do this weekly/daily like you would schedule lunch with a friend or soccer practice for the kids. Clearing your space and getting rid of the old makes so much room for the new and it will feel amazing.</p>\n\n<p>OPEN YOUR WINDOWS: Windows are on your house or apartment for a reason! Open them and let some of that natural light and fresh air in. So many spaces are stagnant because nothing is flowing through them. We, as human beings, need sunlight, we need fresh air, we need to feel the world around us. Feel the sun on your face, the wind in your hair, go outside, or if weather doesn’t permit look out the window and take note of what’s around you. If your scenery does not permit, go find a park or somewhere that does and sit there for a while. Being in natural surroundings helps you think clearer.</p>\n\n<p>START THE DAY WITH A GOOD THOUGHT: Whether it be a positive mantra, a picture of your family, or a statement about what you want to accomplish, you should live every day with purpose. And a positive mantra can be as simple as “today is my day!” or “today is an amazing day,” or “I attract all the right people in my life today.” It can be whatever you want, but it should be positive and it should be something you can take ownership of. Do this and don’t sweat the small stuff. Suddenly you will rise above daily nuances and things that used to throw you off track, and you will align yourself with a deeper goal and meaning of purpose.</p>\n\n<p>TURN OFF THE NOISE: Checking social media and email have become the nervous tics that move our society in a strange direction I’m not always sure is forward. We want to know whats going on all the time. We see an email come in and we have to read it. We just finished lunch and we need to go online to find out what everyone else ate. Social media, while effective when used in the right way, is also a huge time hog and can kill your productivity. The same goes for sporatic email checking. Set times to check your email and social media that work with your schedule so its a welcomed break and not a hinderance to your work. Email can be checked at (for example) 10am, 12noon, and 3pm. Social media can be checked at 12noon and at the end of the day. If you run social media campaigns for work, utilize an app that can schedule your posts, so you don’t have to check in all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Now go forth and be productive!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "4:20PM in fair Boulder, where we lay our scene.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soothing hush of the office is broken by the sound of an <a href=\"http://upslopebrewing.com/beer/craft-lager/\">Upslope Lager</a> being opened. Although many would think that the dojo's dizzying creativity is due to a good old fashioned 4:20 smokedown, we are readying for our weekly organizational development meeting. If you had asked me a few months ago what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_development\">organizational development</a> meant, I would have replied 'beats me.'<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery week the dojo4 staff convenes for exercises and instruction that leads us towards a stronger team dynamic and more effective communication. At the outset of the org dev process we discussed what each team member requires to feel energetic and productive. Each team member has their own working style and approach to the dojo4 culture. Steve Bailey requires a morning full of equestrian tantra and Fred Jean loves to retreat to his garden sanctum where flower petals blow freely on the cool breeze. Some folks require social engagement and other love the quiet of a still workspace. It's important to have the option to work quietly and to be socially engaged when appropriate. We find that knowing each others working style breeds understanding and mutual trust. Except for the fact that Kerry writes Python. That is one issue none of us feel secure about. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn later sessions the org dev facilitators <a href=\"http://www.goodwork.be\">Michael Rich</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leadershipreboot.com/about\">Sam Elmore</a> discussed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain\">triune brain model</a>. This model posits that the brain consists of a reptilian, paleomammalian and a neomammalian layer. In high-stress situations resources that would normally be allocated to the higher brain functioning of the cerebral cortex (neomammalian) get directed to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala\">amygdala</a>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala\">amygdala</a> is the region of the brain that is acutely active during a stress response. The human neural network is a product of billions of years of survival and hair-trigger fight or flight responses. During the often intense world of client interaction, team conflict, and deadlines these survival mechanisms  pose a threat to the sanity of the team and the individual. We use the colors green, yellow, or red to indicate our personal stress level to ourself and to teammates. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce awareness is brought to discordant mental states we find it easier to metabolize the emotion or mental state and get back into a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow</a> state. The ability to sustain an increased sense of existential intensity is helpful for having any disturbing interpersonal communications with team members or clients. In a professional context we often try to evade disturbance and its accompanying anxiety in favor of short-term solutions or passivity.  When disturbing issues are avoided they sometimes fester and can transform into a ritualized struggle that can mask the original interpersonal or professional difficulty. Right now we are exercising our teams ability to have honest and skillful discussions around topics that may otherwise trigger a contraction into <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/steve-bailey\">self-absorbtion</a> or doughnut binges.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe process will be ongoing and I will continue to report on my findings. I think in the long run many of these practices are necessary for a team culture to thrive. The caveat is that initially the process can be a bit disruptive and adds another meeting to a studio's already busy schedule. <br><br>\r\n\r\nNo blog post is complete without a candid of a team member.<br><br><img src='/ro/dojo4/org-dev-dojo/assets/wtfhd.png'>",

It has an adventure full of ups and downs, challenging technologies and being surrounded by an amazing crew.</p>\n\n<p>I first heard of the Dojo four years ago. I was attending a Ruby code and coffee event when Jeremy mentioned that he was going to work at the dojo. I asked about this mystical place but hesitated to visit at first. I eventually overcame that hesitation and became a frequent visitor. I must warn you: hanging out at the dojo puts you at high risk of working for the dojo. I eventually heard of a position that dojo4 was recruiting for. I applied and my fate was sealed.</p>\n\n<p>I returned to the dojo a little more than a year later to join as a full time employee. Here, I had the chance to work with amazing clients on deeply interesting projects. There was iOS, infrastructure, front end, back end, ops, devops, noops opportunities. Lots of MVP, some ongoing maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I was missing working at scale. So I answered the call of a local startup who already has a product and a steep growth curve who needed help with scaling, expanding and running their product. Dealing with millions of emails a day is going to force me to up my game to a few  levels.</p>\n\n<p>It is bitter sweet to leave such a crew behind, but they’ll do just fine. They are amazing in their own ways.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll post more details of my adventures on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fredjean\">my twitter feed</a> and <a href=\"http://fredjean.net\">on my blog</a>. Stay posted!</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>We worked hard against the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/maternity-leave-paid-parental-leave-_n_2617284.html\">sad American status quo</a> and the difficult financial realities of being a small business to come up with at least <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/have-babies-at-dojo4\">a reasonably acceptable parental leave policy</a> at dojo4. I feel very lucky to have been afforded a parental leave, and now feel lucky to be able to come back to a workplace that is flexible enough to accommodate the ups and downs, constraints and requirements inherent to being a working parent. And now that I’m back in the office (at least partially) since my daughter, Florence, was born earlier this summer, these complexities of being a ‘<a href=\"http://static.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/MjAxMy1kNDNlYWY3MTQ1ZWI3ZjM1.png\">working mother</a>’ are becoming increasingly familiar if not less complex, to me: juggling constantly shifting work schedules with my husband, negotiating affordable and attentive childcare, figuring out how to breastfeed and still leave Florence for hours at a time, switching from ‘work brain’ to ‘new parent brain’ and back several times a day, and all the while on a less than optimal sleep ration.</p>\n\n<p>I returned after 5 weeks, which is much sooner than what I believe should be policy and sooner what I would expect from an employee. But as a business owner, I was thinking about work enough anyway that it seemed more effective to actually do the work when I was thinking about it, so that I can dedidate myself undividedly to my daughter and husband the rest of the time. And although hectic as hell and heartbreaking to leave Florence most days, it also feels great to be back at work.</p>\n\n<p>And, in fact, it turns out, according to the data that Pamela Brooke at <a href=\"http://www.humanresourcesmba.net/\">Human Resources MBA</a> sent after reading about our work at dojo4 to create a sustainable parental leave policy, that <a href=\"http://www.humanresourcesmba.net/work-after-baby/\">mothers who return to work are substantially happier and healthier</a> (see infographic). In order to be happy to return to work after having babies, you have to be able to leave properly in the first place. But American society and policy has a lot of catching up to do to get us to that place, where we can adequately take care of our families and career paths, without one being at the expense of the other.</p>\n\n<p>At dojo4, we design and build elegant, robust custom web sites and applications, and take pride in our work. But I think one of our most important contributions to the community is reflected in the culture we’ve worked together to create that supports job security for our team members to be able to spend crucial time with our families and return to work, happier and healthier.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.humanresourcesmba.net/work-after-baby/\"><img src=\"http://ig.humanresourcesmba.net/working-moms.png\" alt=\"Work After Baby\" width=\"500\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />Source: <a href=\"http://www.humanresourcesmba.net/work-after-baby/\">Work After Baby</a></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "title": "! 'Business Advice from the Movie: Hitch'",
      "author": "jessica@jwatsoncreative.com",
      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p><img src='/ro/dojo4/business-advice-from-the-movie-hitch/assets/hitchmovie.jpg' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n<p>Hitch is a 2005 romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant and starring Will Smith. The film, which was written by Kevin Bisch, co-stars Eva Mendes, Kevin James, and Amber Valletta. Date Doctor Alex Hitchens aids his clients in sweeping the women of their dreams off their feet, boasting that all you need is the right broom.</p>\n\n<p>As a woman of business, I was curious if any of the advice he gave his clients about dating could be applied to business as well as dealing with clients and customers. I’ve come up with 5 tips that translate very well.</p>\n\n<h2>Knowing what you want</h2>\n\n<p>Hitch says “Even a beautiful women doesn’t know what she wants until she sees it.” Can the same be true of your clients and customers? Often times our clients may have a general idea of what they want, such as “I need a website,” or “I need a mobile app,” but they don’t really understand why or what it needs to do. As a business owner, this is your opportunity to shine. A potential client is coming to you because they need your creative expertise. Step up to the plate and be an expert. Get to the root of the basic needs of your prospect, and then wow them with what you can deliver. Make them fall in love with the process and the end result.</p>\n\n<h2>Listen and respond</h2>\n\n<p>Hitch reminds us that in the moment we should “listen and respond.” This is actually true of all relationships and all forms of communication in life. But let’s focus on business. Often we get caught up in the full range of quality services we can offer a client, that we automatically assume they want a certain kind of website or a certain type of bundle that we offer. That is actually rarely the case. In practicing the concept of really listening to the client you start to hear what their concerns are, and you also hear what their ambitions are in terms of what they’re striving for. Pull that information out, and then find the skills and services you offer that match it.</p>\n\n<h2>The sign off</h2>\n\n<p>Hitch says, “A woman’s best friend must sign off on all big relationship decisions.” Well, its not quite your prospect’s best friend, but it’s usually a board, an advisor, or various members of an internal team. Help equip your prospect with the information they need to sell the project to their company. Do this within reason of course, but if you have case studies, or examples of similar projects, or even write ups from other satisfied customers, that information should be readily accessible so it can be used to your advantage.</p>\n\n<h2>Non-verbal communication</h2>\n\n<p>Hitch says, “60% of all human communication is non-verbal, 30% is your tone; so that means that 90% of what you’re saying, ain’t coming out of your mouth.” This is true. A potential client can pick up on your behavior and non-verbal cues. Are you confident in the solutions you’re presenting? How do you feel about that number you told them (your fee, etc)? If you are not confident in what you’re selling, it doesn’t matter how great the presentation is, it could effect the outcome. Remember, a client is looking for you to be the expert, while also embodying the ability to assess their needs and deliver something unique for them. Own it.</p>\n\n<h2>The first time</h2>\n\n<p>Hitch says, “8 out of 10 women think that the first kiss will tell them everything they need to know about a relationship.” Well, you probably won’t get a first kiss in a business relationship, but that first phone call or in person meeting is a very critical part of the process. And just like dating, it plays a huge role on whether or not you make the cut and move on to round 2. Use the natural talents you have, and the elements of your personality that make you shine. As a business you have the advantage of sometimes bringing in a team member if needed. The best advice is really establish that human connection, allowing you to go above and beyond the sell.</p>\n\n<p>It is after all just a movie, but often times pearls of wisdom come from some very unexpected places.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

Granted none of us suffered the catastrophic and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/15/us-usa-colorado-flooding-idUSBRE98B0KM20130915\">tragic loses</a> that many of our neighbors have, but <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/garett-shulman\">Garett</a> and his pregnant wife, Molly, has been without potable water all week, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard\">Ara</a>’s been housing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenstreet\">Greg Greenstreet</a> and his family since the emergency evacuation from their inundated house in Four Mile Canyon, and <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/luke-miller\">Luke</a>’s parents house looked like an ark about to float away on the lake that was their yard.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s certainly not because most of our immediate team came away mostly unscathed that we are cheerful. Instead I chalk our cheerfulness up to having taken the opportunity that this natural disaster has afforded us to think about and pitch in for other people. As the <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Shantideva\">adage</a> goes: “All the happiness there is in this world comes from thinking about others, and all the suffering comes from preoccupation with yourself.” And if there is one thing that this type of catastrophe brings it’s the inescapable obviousness of others’ suffering that gets us outside ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>After weathering the storm ourselves, we all went over to Luke’s parents house to help clean up the wreckage and haul out the flood waste. Ara and friends have been hiking up Four Mile to help salvage the Greenstreet’s valuables and rescue their pets. And we’ve all been checking in on our neighbors and friends to see how we can help.</p>\n\n<p>This week has brought story after story of nearly inconceivable destruction, calamity and misfortune. And along with those, it has brought even more affecting stories of neighbors, friends and strangers helping each other and being cheerfully relieved of the burden of thinking only of ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>At the Miller’s house:\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/photo-1.JPG' alt=\"img\" />\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/photo-3.JPG' alt=\"img\" />\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/photo-2.JPG' alt=\"img\" />\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/photo-4.JPG' alt=\"img\" />\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/photo.JPG' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n<p>Landslide on the way to Four Mile:\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/2013-09-12-17.21.23.jpg' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Greenstreet’s home:\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/if-you-want-to-be-happy-think-of-others/assets/2013-09-13-12.49.01.jpg' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>For a new iOS developer, they can be really confusing. You have an app that you simply want other people to be able to test on their device, and you get directed to the Apple developer portal with certificates, devices, and provisioning profiles. Before your body goes into shock, read the rest of this post for a simple explanation of it all.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2623?token=JlOjG8C7kRhUxTp9Bba_TPBP4jRCn0dL-2ugH03kEATD52BLmxZYEnY4Vynx55mzHS9ub3I5QR29W1MVWjkBA0k\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The combination of certificates, devices, and provisioning profiles is Apple’s answer to some difficult questions:</p>\n\n<p>Q: How do you guarantee the app you’re downloading hasn’t been modified by some hacker and it’s actually from the developer/company that it says it’s from?</p>\n\n<p>A: <strong>Certificates.</strong> Ever learned about PGP encrypted email? That whole business where there’s a public key and a private key? That’s what’s going on here, except you’re abstracted from having to worry about that because of the Mac app “Keychain Access”. When you add a new certificate in the portal and follow the instructions to use “Keychain Access” to upload a certificate request, “Keychain Access” uses your private key to create a public key, which is then embedded into the certificate request that gets sent to Apple. Apple hands you back a certificate that you then put into your keychain (now you can download and add it through Xcode automatically).</p>\n\n<p><em>(Update: it looks like you can have Xcode manage your certificates/”Signing identities” in preferences as well.)</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2624?token=w3b1zrNeBBqC2WRMbEvt7BKrWA0U5A_FhTLXE9Uvex6mYA5pxwSfYG5M1GGWhYd0TkzxxiD8UUIyN7GA34d8NHQ\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note that there are different certificates for different scenarios too. Developer certificates are used when you’re just getting any old app (app id: *) to work and you’re developing locally and on your development device that’s tethered to your computer. An AdHoc certificate is used when you want to allow a few testers to install your app on their device before the public AppStore release. AppStore and AdHoc certificates are tied to a specific app (app id), and they usually use an organization’s certificate, since the certificate is how Apple knows what to show on the “Developed By” line in the App Store listing.</p>\n\n<p>Q: How can we allow a handful of testers to install the app on their phone and try it out before we release it to the whole world through the App Store?</p>\n\n<p>A: <strong>Devices &amp; Provisioning Profiles.</strong> Apple only allows its users to install apps through the App Store. But when you’re a developer and you want some people to try it out before it goes to the App Store, you need to use provisioning profiles and devices.</p>\n\n<p>First, you get someone to give you their device UUID (universally unique identifier), which usually is done through a service like <a href=\"http://www.testflight.com\">Testflight</a> or <a href=\"http://hockeyapp.net/\">HockeyApp</a> where a person can sign up to be one of your testers and the service will automatically email you their UUID. In order to prevent you from circumventing the App Store, Apple restricts you to only adding 100 devices in a year to your iOS developer account.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2625?token=vjMPdsPjLmPKBD1DOANNeAD_QkMIQO7y8jE7HvP0sZCej5dwCQjQYVwVdReo7bJE6iZX53ZFBOeVrd5jtElccdU\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then you create a provisioning profile. Each provisioning profile incorporates a certificate in order to sign the app securely from a specific person/organization. Provisioning profiles also declare who is able to install the build of the app. In the case of an App Store provisioning profile, it’s saying that that build of the app can be installed by anyone as long as it’s downloaded through the App Store.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2626?token=9C_AJjhMWZQw2pe-0cdxMSUfRssZ-8gogKWU21qGyDaXl7G41hC7-eD8eCQ6rjq6oUtrZqdN_Yo-LvXyI13txqg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>When you’re getting some testers on board, you’ll want to use an Ad Hoc provisioning profile (and certificate). In the “Edit” screen of the provisioning profile, you’ll be able to select any of the devices listed in “Devices” in your developer portal. Check the box next to the ones you want to include (Note: you can always check or uncheck more or less later).</p>\n\n<p>Generate this profile, download it manually or through the Xcode preferences, select it when archiving your app, and then you’ll be able to upload that .ipa file to a service like Testflight for your testers to install.</p>\n\n<p>Some more guiding images:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Having Xcode automatically download provisioning profiles and certificates for you:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2627?token=0uiybrTmNZrs-1G5S3pUkV_02FcnA2PPVTNOPkIa7ugiQP8QMHhfk6swlm_kFIBOIUyv8GpmP3bATsCZylUkf20\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Updating certificate (“Signing identity”) selected in the project’s build settings in Xcode:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2628?token=_yRFxLYAdihsFQWVEXwJVQi1JRH16YWIS-BHD0_NmLxyPzqnFg2HwgZknb_DDSBh93Bk1mHAOaOm3ZS5ug4r5bM\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>So we like trying out random front end frameworks here at dojo4 on projects, and the latest one we’ve tried is <a href=\"http://spinejs.com/\">SpineJS</a>. Here are my thoughts after using it on a couple of projects:</p>\n\n<p><em>Pros:</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Short, open source code.</strong> Anytime I had a question about how the framework was interpreting my code, it was incredibly simple to open the source files and read the code for myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Solid web server tool in Hem</strong> Everything you need to get a front-end app up and running is provided to you with hem and SpineJS. Tests are automatically setup and easy to modify. Hem also has a nice <code>-d</code> flag, which won’t minify your application to make it easier to debug in development.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Built in data persistence layer</strong> SpineJS ships with Ajax and LocalStorage adaptors for your models which are really easy to use and subclass. It’s also easy to write your own since you have the source code for the Ajax and LocalStorage adaptors and they’re pretty short.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Active Google Group and github community</strong> Whenever I had questions along the way there was always someone in the community able to lend an idea. They have a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/spinejs\">Google Group</a> and an active <a href=\"https://github.com/spine\">github organization</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Coffeescript is awesome.</strong> This point is less about SpineJS, but SpineJS was my first use of Coffeescript and it rules. I should write a blog post all about Coffeescript but it rules for its ease of reading without all of those cluttering parentheses and semi-colons, scoping functions with the fat arrow, and the question mark to prevent me from having to do tons of existential conditionals. And oh yea – classes.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cons:</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Docs aren’t totally complete.</strong> I guess this point isn’t exactly fair because their documentation is more like a collection of explained examples instead of a true API documentation, but the point remains that <a href=\"https://github.com/spine/spine.site/issues/52\">there are functions</a> within the framework that aren’t addressed in the docs. However, with point #1 above, it’s super easy to read the source code yourself.</p>\n\n<p><em>Overall:</em></p>\n\n<p>Overall I’d recommend this framework and am highly likely to use it again. Between the simplicity and ease of use of Coffeescript and SpineJS, they seem like a match made in web heaven.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Like every development shop, we get a lot of people coming to us wanting to create an app for both iOS and Android. They want to figure out a way to save time and money by not completely duplicating work on their app for each OS. So naturally we’ll talk with these potential clients about architecture options using HTML content and web views. (Our most recent client wanted to share functionality between an iOS app and a website as well, so we were especially directed toward using HTML in the mobile app.) Along this path, the thought of using Phonegap always comes up. We’ve been down this road a few times, and here are our conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>Phonegap sucks. Here’s why:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Learning a whole new framework when you should be learning Obj-C or Java.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Depending on them to support OS features (cross your fingers it exists and works! cross your fingers they support new stuff quickly!)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Mess of an organization—Phonegap? Cordova? Which is it?!?!?! (Just use Phonegap and you’ll be fine—Okay… oh wait, I have to use the cordova CLIto add plugins?!)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Outdated, incorrect, and confusing documentation (partly due to the above point)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The community around it is more concerned with supporting every device on the planet instead of helping a developer take some HTML content and publishing it effortlessly in one of the main 2 OSes. (Well that’s what Phonegap Cloud is for—tried to use it 3 times, it’s broken.)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, Phonegap is focused on making you 10% satisfied on 100% of the devices in the world. In our experience, clients care about being 100% satisfied on only 2 of the devices in the world—iOS and Android.</p>\n\n<p>So what’s our solution? Embrace Obj-C and Java! HTML content in an app is a great way for simple apps to have a single code base on multiple platforms, but you need fine grain control over the entire app and you need to follow Apple and Google’s instructions on how to take advantage of their OS features. So we have frameworks (iOS nearly ready for open sourcing &amp; Android still in early works) that contain one web view and then use small, open source libraries to create a bridge between that web view and the native application. This allows us to write our own Javascript API to call whatever native code we write. (For iOS, we use the awesome WebViewJavascriptBridge by Marcus Westin)</p>\n\n<p>For example, when we have HTML content that wants to share a link to Facebook or Twitter, we wrote our own Javascript API to say:</p>\n\n<p>bridge.callHandler(‘facebookShare’, ‘<a href=\"http://ducksarethebest.com’\" target=\"_blank\">http://ducksarethebest.com’</a>);\nand then in Objective-C, we wrote the handler to take that URL and use the official Facebook iOS SDK to share that link:</p>\n\n<p>[_bridge registerHandler:@”facebook_share” handler:^(id data, WVJBResponseCallback responseCallback) {\nFBAppCall *appCall = [FBDialogs presentShareDialogWithLink:[NSURL URLWithString:data] handler:fbHandler];\n}];\nThis is a dramatically better experience than letting the web view share that link because if the user already has the Facebook app and is signed into it, the Facebook SDK won’t require them to log in again, whereas the web view sharing method will.</p>\n\n<p>It’s even better for solutions where there isn’t a web alternative, like in-app purchases. And especially something so vital to the success of your app—users paying you money—you want to make sure it’s done correctly in the most up-to-date and recommended way. The only way to do that is to follow Apple or Google’s guidelines in their official SDK.</p>\n\n<p>This approach gives us the flexibility to write whatever JS API works best for us, the immediacy of taking advantage of any feature available in the iOS or Android SDKs, and it improves our development skills in a language and SDK that actually matter to our long term careers. Most importantly, the client is happy that we’re in full control of the app, we’re not relying on some 3rd party group to support features that Apple or Google released months ago, and the app can be as truly native or web-based as it takes to create the best user experience.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

And meetings do not need to take a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of shutting yourself in a stuffy room with coworkers or clients, take the conversation outside. Go for a walk- the best meetings happen when there is a change of scenery, fresh air and bodies are moving. Sometimes it actually helps communication not to be face-to-face, but walking side by side, going somewhere. Especially difficult conversations can be easier to have when in motion.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show that being in motion lengthens <a href=\"http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/What_is_the_length_of_an_audiences_attention_span_12517.aspx\">our attention spans</a>, but even if people are interested in the meeting and even if they actually care, attention spans still hover around 7-10 minutes for most meetings. So we’ve found that it helps maintain morale and a general sense of good humor to keep meetings short, to-the-point and to move them outside whenever possible.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>With any project, I’m running several programs at once during the development process. This usually results in several tabs in the Terminal app - one for my local server, one for my database, one for my client application, and one for git. (Right now I use a GUI editor (ST2), but I may be reverting to vim soon…) This multiple tab setup re-occurs for each project I’m working on, and I’m usually switching between multiple projects several times a day.</p>\n\n<p>With this multi-tab setup, when I have to switch the project that I’m working on, I have to either open a new Terminal window with its own tabs for that project and deal with having a more than required number of windows open (not an option for a minimalist like myself) or close all of the tabs I have open, only to re-open them all when I switch back to that project.</p>\n\n<p>Well like most days, I learned a clever solution to this problem from the dojo4 wise and all-powerful leader, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard\">Ara</a>. He uses the GNU <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/\">Screen</a> program. Within a single Terminal tab, Screen allows you to open multiple “windows” (aka tabs) within the same Terminal tab. Here’s how to use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\"># creating and reattaching to a session\nscreen -S [name] = create a named screen\nscreen -D -R [name] = reattach to a named screen and detach other people if nec\nscreen -list = list screens\n\n# (exiting all windows in a screen session will exit that session. However a screen session is a running process, so you can kill it manually.)\n\n# within a screen session:\nctrl-A + ? = help\nctrl-A + \" = list windows\nctrl-A + c = create new window\nctrl-A + n = next window\nctrl-A + p = previous window\nctrl-A + A = rename a window\n\n# aliases we use\nalias sl='screen -list '\nalias sdr='screen -d -r '\nalias s='screen -D -R '\nalias ss='screen -S'\n\nsdr [name] = reattach to a named screen and detach other people if nec\nss [name] = create a named screen\nsl = list screens\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another really cool feature of screen is that when you detach from a screen session, all of your windows remain running, and when you re-attach to the screen session, you have all of your windows back at your disposal.</p>\n\n<p>When we discussed this in our office, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ryan-cook\">Ryan Cook</a> created a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/cookrn/2711966\">nice little Ruby helper</a> to create screen sessions that are named after your current directory.</p>\n\n<p>So my workflow has changed from having multiple tabs in Terminal open to a single tab in Terminal where I re-connect to a screen session for each project I’m working on. That allows me to switch projects extremely quickly and to stop wasting time re-setting up and re-tearing down all of the Terminal tabs I’m using for a project.</p>\n\n<p>Now I just have to convert more things to terminal usage (like my editor) in order to really make the most of screen…</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Being a great engineer is an art, not a science.</p>\n\n<p>Hiring great engineers is more like dating than anything else.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, on my daily hikes over Mt. Sanitas to @dojo4 I’ve been trying to answer seemingly simple questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Why is it hard to hire <em>great</em> engineers?</li>\n  <li>What <em>is</em> a great engineer?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Typically, I’ll begin to categorize, formalize, and arrange ideal traits in my mind as the trail gets steeper (I do stuff like that while I’m hiking).  Later, when my breathing labors and oxygen deprivation has focused my mind a bit more, I come back to the same set of ideas.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, I <em>know</em> the answers to both of the above questions but, on the other, I’ve found that trying to formulate precise answers has become harder and harder to pin down, as I’ve pondered them more and more on each passing hike.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I’ve arrived at the conclusion that describing <em>how</em> great engineers are, is more meaningful than describing <em>what</em> they are.</p>\n\n<p>It’s probably important to mention here, that what <em>I</em> mean when I say ‘great engineer’, might be different from what <em>you</em> mean.</p>\n\n<p>–</p>\n\n<p>I mean technicians who build useful solutions to real human problems.</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia sums this up similarly:</p>\n\n<p>The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human needs and quality of life. In short, engineers are versatile minds who create links between science, technology, and society.</p>\n\n<p>ref: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer</a></p>\n\n<p>By this definition and my own, one isn’t an engineer when one’s work:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>doesn’t address the needs of real humans.</li>\n  <li>doesn’t create solutions that are adopted by groups of humans.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I don’t think most engineers actually evaluate themselves by a similar definition - instead, preferring an assessment based on technical skill alone, and leaving the human litmus tests as the responsibility of business and marketing teams.</p>\n\n<p>This is unfortunate, and a topic for a future post…</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, here are some of the practices I’ve witnessed in successful engineers, and ones that I’ve grown to identify as indicators of the type of engineer who is going to consistently - problem after problem - be able to deliver solutions to large groups of other living, breathing human beings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"great-engineers-use-hammers\">Great engineers use hammers</h2>\n\n<p>No, I don’t mean “rm -rf”. I mean hammers, metal ones that bang nails in.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing tests engineering skill (vs. technical skill) like solving a problem outside one’s domain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>bathroom to tile?</li>\n  <li>bridge to build?</li>\n  <li>satellite dish to calibrate?</li>\n  <li>sump pump to repair?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Being a technician, means being limited by tools and skill, but being an engineer, means being limited only by problem solving skills and communication - so pick up that f***ing manual and figure out how to wire the thermostat today; tomorrow, you can figure out how to change the oil.</p>\n\n<p>(An interesting titbit on hammers: does a titanium one produce more force on impact than a lead one?  Does it depend on how fast you swing it? Is it  ‘easier’ or ‘harder’ to use a light hammer vs. a heavy one.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"great-engineers-are-athletes\">Great engineers are athletes</h2>\n\n<p>All systems are engineered for humans.  And all organic systems follow the same cyclical pattern of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stress</li>\n  <li>Recovery</li>\n  <li>Regeneration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Moving through this cycle, is how athletes gain fitness.  But it’s also how populations grow, over extend themselves, experience famine, and begin to grow again.</p>\n\n<p>No biological system experiences growth in a linear fashion.</p>\n\n<p>When engineers are out of touch with the realities of their bodies (and everyone else’s), they develop ideologies that model machines instead of organic systems.  For example, the concept of ‘velocity’ in agile development is seen as something that should be predictable in the future, and consistent given a certain team size. In fact, we know that all organic systems experiencing stress are going to move through small and large periodic cycles of activation and fatigue.  This means that periods of high velocity are always going to be followed by periods of low velocity, and that this is to be expected and actively planned for.  It’s been an accepted pillar of producing peak performance in the professional coaching community since the 1950s - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_periodization\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_periodization</a> - but an engineering community that identifies with machines more than people hasn’t quite gotten there yet.</p>\n\n<p>Many individual engineers, however, are there now.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t need to run marathons, or lift 500 pounds to learn about biological rhythms.  Riding to work, backpacking, doing yoga, or just taking long walks is sufficient to learn about this fact of nature when practiced <em>consistently</em> when feeling good, and <em>also</em> when feeling bad.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the periodic nature of human beings lets great engineers have insight into problems, users, teams, project trajectories, and even markets - all organic systems.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"great-engineers-listen-to-good-music\">Great engineers listen to good music</h2>\n\n<p>Good problem solving is both non-linear, and pattern recognition based, and developing abstractions means being able to see the forest and not the trees.</p>\n\n<p>Appreciating good music - let alone playing it - requires all of these skills in spades.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout my programming career I’ve noticed that great engineers - the ones helping real humans solve real problems - have a love for great music and are often musicians themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Mediocre ones seem to think Pandora is a ‘pretty neat idea’ and really haven’t considered how having sounds bouncing around in their heads, and making sense of it, is pretty much <em>just like</em> reasoning about complex systems. Or why listening to bluegrass or opera - even if you don’t like it - is a <em>lot like</em> learning Lisp when you’ve been stuck programming C.  Or why the JVM is the glam metal of engineering tools.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a Google search for ‘image of java’ brings this up:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-5-mystical-practices-of-great-engineers/assets/3644.jpeg' alt=\"java.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>and one for ‘ruby’, this:</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-5-mystical-practices-of-great-engineers/assets/3645.jpeg' alt=\"ruby.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Kidding aside, my observation has been that reviewing an engineer’s music collection for interesting stuff is as reliable a metric as any for assessing how often they’ll be able to get someone else’s problem solved, and how harmonic their own solutions will be.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"great-engineers-do-hard-physical-labor\">Great engineers do hard physical labor</h2>\n\n<p>There are two issues that crop up repeatedly with engineers that don’t sometimes perform hard physical labor:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>They develop solutions that are too expensive.</li>\n  <li>They develop solutions that are too resource intensive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The field of engineering operates in a weird vacuum where six-figure budgets are the norm, and even small projects take months. There really aren’t checks and balances in the field that knock concepts back to the real world of energy and effort.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, many people in software consider their work as something magical that transforms mere ether into piles of money with nothing but huge brain power applied.  They forget that the Cloud is made of metal boxes, connected with wires, and burning tons of oil every second to keep those magnetic media spinning on bearings made by children in China.</p>\n\n<p>Lately, it’s become fashionable for some engineers to participate in things like - cycling, CrossFit, running, etc. - but these activities, while beneficial, don’t measure as highly on the “über engineer” scale when compared to solving problems through the application of physical and mental effort <em>_combined_</em>.  Operating your mind and your body independently is a different mode of operation, than operating them both together, which is exponentially more difficult.  Nothing brings you back to reality like moving a ton of rock, digging a ditch, or painting all day.  The clever idea you had at 7am - that seemed like a great one at the time - is a faint memory.  Actually, you may have forgotten why you climbed up that ladder …  It turns out that solutions that are hard to implement make you tired, and that being tired <em>makes you stupid</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Solving problems through pure effort teaches engineers about what <em>hard</em> really is. That something doesn’t need to be an order of harder magnitude to become a total PITA, and that fatigue puts a mental premium on simplicity and the hand cuffs on complexity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"great-engineers-make-great-lovers\">Great engineers make great lovers</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone knows that engineers are famous for their love-making ability.</p>\n\n<p>;-)</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing. It’s hard to develop solutions for a great many people when you don’t understand a great many people.  It’s also really hard to develop an understanding for people that are different from us without being in an intimate relationship with them.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone that’s married can tell you how profoundly difficult it is to understand his or her, so being in a relationship is a tried and true way to stretch these muscles.</p>\n\n<p>Truthfully, what this last practice is speaking to, isn’t whether you have a wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, or all four - but whether or not you are able to identify closely with other people that are <em>very different</em> from yourself.</p>\n\n<p>It is a rare engineer that solves problems only for other engineers, and even then, what makes sense and is helpful for someone else, is a remarkably difficult thing to get right.</p>\n\n<p>Great engineering, after all, stems from understanding the problems of others; thus, the most valued skill an engineer can have is the ability to understand deeply, someone with a mind that is completely different than their own.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>So there you have it.  5 practices great problem solvers practice.</p>\n\n<p>Some of you may have noticed that <em>none</em> of them are mystical; in fact, they’re all quite human.  Other readers may be poised on the comment button with the reaction that none of these have anything to do with engineering and, for them, the path to becoming the most versatile, powerful, engineer possible may indeed <em>be</em> mystical.</p>\n\n<p>:::</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<p>Responsive websites are here to stay, and for good reason. There is currently no better method for molding content to the growing plethora of devices and device sizes on the market. However, while the technology has changed, the design/development process has remained fairly stagnant.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this is fairly straight forward: Most agencies are stuck in outdated staffing models where a division between designers and front-end developers still exists. For new responsive design paradigms to work, this has to change.</p>\n\n<p>One method of addressing this issue is to bridge the gap between design and developer. We have found this strategy is less than ideal. Developer on developer pairing may have its merits, but designers and developers have such inherently different processes that it quickly becomes problematic and ultimately hinders the project.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we here at dojo4 have decided that it's in our best interest to have multi-faceted employees. Not only do we seek these employees, we strongly encourage skill expansion. As a result, we have designers who can code and coders who can design. This allows us to start and finish our responsive design process nearly entirely in browser.</p>\n\n<p>Our design process starts with a quick organization of content by way of a site map or user flowchart. This allows us to identify pages and templates that need wireframing love as we move into the next phase of our process.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed the first phase for its quaintness as it is the only phase spent outside of our beloved browser.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to getting started with wireframes, we set-up our environments and sort out any dependencies (i.e. Bootstrap, jquery, fontawesome and Middleman). It's also at the point the we get any deployment needs addressed (namely setting up rake tasks and S3 buckets). Once we are all set to build and deploy, we start to rock and/or roll.</p>\n\n<p>Working from the aforementioned deliverables (site map), we begin to build out grayscale wires. While the wires are responsive, they are very much no-frill. All content and javascript components (tabs/dropdowns/tootips/&amp;c.) have base styling and base functionality. Images and icons are either stock or grayed/boxed with a description. The goal here is to cement page architecture and responsive breakpoint decisions without thinking about or lingering on design decisions – those come next.</p>\n\n<p>After the wires are locked into place, we are able to move into the design phase of the project. We typically generate a pattern portfolio. In fairness, our pattern portfolios are somewhere between a living style tile and a pattern portfolio. They show color and typography choices in addition to element and component design: headers, footers, forms, buttons, tabs, lists, paragraphs, titles, subtitles, and any other substantial piece as learned from the wires. We consider these to be the materials of our little web house.</p>\n\n<p>With the pattern portfolio approved, we start integrating the designed elements into our html wires. We also begin flowing content, inputting data, doing any data modeling and hooking up CMS components if one is used. While much of the work has been done at this point, this is generally the phase that feels like the actual building of the site.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, we have a draft site on staging and ready for review. There is typically a round or two of revisions – small changes and tweaks. And then comes the fun part, pushing the little red button that sends the site into the world where it finally gets to start doing work and prove itself to be the best and baddest on the interwebs... until the next launch, that is.</p>",

      "author": "miles@dojo4.com",
      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Today I had the pleasure of speaking at Northglenn Middle School to the 8th grade class for <a href=\"http://code.org/\">Code.org’s</a> “Hour of Code”. The hour of code is an initiative to introduce computer programming into as many schools as possible with the hope that schools will begin teaching programming in more schools full time, and in the very least, get more kids interested in writing code.</p>\n\n<p>In preparing my talk, I was worried most about speaking about things at their knowledge level. I wasn’t worried about them being interested, since I know most of the kids their age already play on and work with computers and mobile devices. My biggest fear was not boring them with too simple of concepts or talking about complicated things above their comprehension, so I tried to keep things simple, yet allow for more in-depth discussion when they asked questions.</p>\n\n<p>After giving my talks, I was blown away by how intersted these kids really were and how much they already knew. It’s easy for people to look at them as kids and think all of it is way too complicated for them, but several of them already understood the concept of code, had mastered basic languages like html, and were thirsty for learning more! A couple of kids even came up to me afterwards and showed me some code they wrote on their phones.</p>\n\n<p>I encouraged the kids that were really interested in starting to code more to visit <a href=\"http://codeacademy.com\">codeacademy.com</a> to learn specific languages, edit a theme on tumblr, or even <a href=\"github.com\">github.com</a> if they really wanted to start building things. I even invited them to email me with questions at miles [at] dojo4 [dot] com.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the technology teacher at Northglenn, Valerie Fink, for inviting me and setting everything up. It was very easy to arrange and I was really welcomed at the school, so I’d recommend to anyone speaking at Northglenn, or any other school, if they get the chance.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/dojo4.com/presentation/d/1uRtLnnUCaJtaXPrNlCOTLNTDi3sMzL-xQf4Kp_X4Jk8/htmlpresent\">link to the slides and notes</a> I used.</p>\n\n<p>Also, their thirst for these classes (one kid even came up to me asking where he could take classes about C++ because he already did Visual Basic!) made me think of having a parent and child meetup where kids and their parents could come learn to code together.</p>\n\n<p>I think getting young people involved in coding as soon as possible is one of the greatest things we can do, not only so more US workers will fill those jobs, but because it’s a great medium for kids to express themselves and be in control of something they build. I’m excited about helping any way I can and was honored to give the talk today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here are some pictures!</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/speaking-at-hour-of-code/assets/img-0883.jpg' alt=\"img\" />\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/speaking-at-hour-of-code/assets/img-0889.jpg' alt=\"img\" />\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/speaking-at-hour-of-code/assets/img-0907.JPG' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>As CTO of a technology agency I’m constantly evaluating new tools, processes, and services.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I’ve been looking at the DigitalOcean platform as part of an ultra-high-availability strategy we’ve been developing for those times when AWS/S3 isn’t enough: when you want to weather a massive outage of an entire cloud provider.</p>\n\n<p>All of Dojo4’s deploys start out as AWS ones for the obvious reason: it is the standard by which all other cloud services are judged.  It has the additional benefit to an agency in that we can point to it as a ‘sane default’ for software we deliver to customers; as the 800 pound gorilla its use is defensible.  However, some rare clients have voiced concerns about AWS outages affecting their sites and applications, in particular monitoring applications which are supposed to report errors about such outages: a recursive problem.  For these cases we’ve been looking at static deploys balanced across cloud providers with DNS, and DigitalOcean has been on the short list of contenders to create and deploy simple static sites hosted by Apache for this purpose as a failsafe for our normal AWS hosted sites.</p>\n\n<p>Recently DigitalOcean (DO) had a wee issue related to it’s security practices: <a href=\"https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/2525\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/2525</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One could summarize this issue as: when you boot up a new cloud box it may or may not have some previous user’s sensitive data lying around on the disk and, when you shut your own cloud box down, you may expose your own sensitive data to some random 3rd party.  Their service provides a way to wipe things clean but it is <em>not the default</em> - the default is to leave <em>whatever was on the disk</em> exposed for the next customer to dig around in.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is a really bad default strategy.</em></p>\n\n<p>On twitter I suggested that I wasn’t surprised by this lax strategy, but that I was disappointed at the way DO handled themselves during the disclosure.   During a brief exchange on twitter I was asked to summarize the source of my non-surprise:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/drawohara\">@drawohara</a> If you wanted to take the time to put it into an email, I&#39;d read and share it with the whole team, and appreciate it greatly. :)</p>&mdash; John Edgar (@jedgar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jedgar/statuses/417579347302944768\">December 30, 2013</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>So, here with 20/20 hindsight and actually trying to be helpful, I’m fulfilling my promise and explaining why I’ve been dragging my feet moving any of our stuff to DigitalOcean’s platform. (Please note that this list compromises feelings and impressions only, but that they’ve been somewhat validated and strengthened by the recent disk scrubbing fiasco):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Visting DO’s home page one is greeted with a blaring marketing message that screams ‘cheap and fast’</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://cl.ly/T8K9/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-30%20at%201.00.09%20PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>given that the platform is ‘built for developers’ I personally find it strange that the team apparently didn’t anticipate developers getting the clear message that of ‘good, fast, and cheap’ one is picking the latter <em>two</em> with DO.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Next, one gets a nice confirmation message that, as start-up, DO is motivated to demonstrate very, very fast growth</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://cl.ly/T8pL/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-30%20at%201.05.20%20PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>this should give any operations engineer a sick in the stomach feeling.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Poking around the site one finds consistent beating of the ‘fast and cheap’ drum, for instance in the referral program</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://cl.ly/T8ww/Screen%20Shot%202013-12-30%20at%201.09.52%20PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>which hammers the message home and suggests devs sell their buddies on fast and cheap without even a shred of information about robustness, consistency, or security.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Reading through the blog it was very clear that DO follows a lean, user driven, development cycle:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/blog_posts/a-lean-start-for-digital-ocean\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.digitalocean.com/blog_posts/a-lean-start-for-digital-ocean</a></p>\n\n<p>and while I admire, approve of, and recommend this kind of approach to software in general, building security and robustness iteratively doesn’t seem like the sweet spot for this kind of business - despite how awesome VCs (who have never fought a security breach in the wild) must think it is. Some things require massive experience and top-down planning: a stack that lets its users store data and execute code on, be it a browser or cloud, fall into the category of ‘I want someone extracting real code from real systems with a history of attack’ and not ‘We listen to users and iterate quickly, learning as we go.’</p>\n\n<p>So, don’t get me wrong, I am still evaluating DigitalOcean as a nice programmable stack on which to deploy simple static sites and I certainly want to see them succeed, but  I have concerns about their culture and if it is the kind of culture that practices defensive vs. reactive security practices and if they’ll be able to maintain their growth, price point, and ultimately funding when, and if, they catch up with the other cloud players in this regard.  Reading through their attitudes and beliefs in the context of the recent debacle (<a href=\"https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/2525\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/2525</a>) gives me some reason to doubt it.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Here at dojo4 we’ve been trying to be more flexible with remote working lately. We love the concept and have been gradually working it into our normal routine with different experiments. Our latest experiment was banishing Steve to a horrible and desolate place called “New Hampshire”. After 3 months of not seeing Steve in person and working completely remote (while the rest of us had a combination of remote/in person), we don’t hate Steve and Steve doesn’t hate us. So win! He’ll post his own blog post soon about his take on the experience, but in the meantime I thought I’d share the tools we use to collaborate remotely and give a few tips on each one.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong><a href=\"https://campfirenow.com/\">campfire</a></strong> This is the main tool that contributes to our ability to work remotely. On the surface campfire is just a group messaging service that doesn’t have very a ton of true messaging features (like individual messaging), but the real power of this tool comes when you hook up the other services you use to notify campfire of activity on those services. We have our github and redmine accounts set up notify campfire anytime anyone does any code or issue editing. We also use the very nice <a href=\"https://github.com/collectiveidea/tinder\">tinder</a> gem to notify campfire when someone deploys an application. Combine this with the below tool, fbomb, and the fact that we can get apps for our phone, it’s extremely easy to keep a finger on the pulse of the company’s day to day activities and interact with our coworkers no matter how far away from the office we are.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ahoward/fbomb\">fbomb</a></strong> fbomb is a bot for campfire that responds to commands. We named ours ‘mr roboto’ and have our own private, customized version of fbomb that we use. It’s fun to do things like <code>/lolcat</code>, but the best commands we have in ‘mr roboto’ are <code>/directory</code> (spits out names, emails, and cell numbers of everyone on our team), <code>/txt [person name] [message]</code> (texts the person you name your message along with your cell number), and <code>/need [person name] [message]</code> (emails and texts the person your message along with big urgent text, “MILES NEEDS YOU”). These commands have solved the issue of people being in campfire, but not being at their computer when we need them. If we really need someone and they’re not responding to mentioning their name in campfire, then we can get their attention with a text and email.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong><a href=\"http://github.com\">github</a></strong> we love this tool obviously. The two things we love about it most - service hooks into campfire and the unlimited private repos we negotiated for a price (they’re some of our best homies).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.redmine.org/\">redmine</a></strong> we have our own custom version of the open source ticket tracker, redmine, running on one of our servers. We love getting emails every time someone edits a ticket we’re watching or adds a new one on a project we’re watching. We also love its integration with campfire and the fact that it’s open source so we can tweak it for our needs.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/\">google hangouts</a></strong> I’m sure you’ve seen this on other people’s lists of remote tools, because it’s awesome. We have a daily standup meeting where we use hangout to make sure everyone is in on the check in. My one <strong>extremely important tip</strong> that has worked wonders for us: create a google calendar event, click “Add Hangout”, and invite everyone to the event. Then everyone that’s invited to the event will be able to click on the same hangout link that everyone else has, preventing you from emailing/messaging a new hangout link around every day. Our daily hangout used to have an additional 10 minutes of setup for hangout, now we just click the button on our calendar event, and everyone’s already there. Super handy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>email lists</strong> We have special email accounts setup (that only someone from dojo4 can email to) to share our daily plans and progress from the day before, and to simply email something to everyone on the team. The first account allows us to find out what anyone else on the team is doing that day, which simply keeps us all in the loop of each others’ plans. The second account allows a sort of “water cooler” environment where we can send each other articles and pictures and have a conversation. We often have “water cooler” sessions randomly in campfire throughout the day, but having email as a secondary place for that is a nice option to separate our goofing around from our stream of work activities.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So that’s our run down that we use and love every day. Tweet us with yours; we’d love to hear it.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

Keith has a great family and we always enjoy their company.  We chatted about the old times and his upcoming trip to London for the world championships of Irish dancing - his daughter is 16 and will be representing Colorado in the event!</p>\n\n<p>Keith has always been someone I admire.  He raced as a professional for Motorola and, to this day, is one of the most suffering, talented, and fearless of all the bike racers I’ve known.  I remember him talking about yoga a good 10 years before anyone else in Boulder considered it fashionable and he’s been a dedicated husband and father for years longer that me. He sure seems to have fun doing it too!</p>\n\n<p>Keith is also a designer and a developer; he’s been at it much longer that I have and is someone to count on for showing up at the party with the coolest shoes.  In short, he is just the kind of guy you want working on your shit.</p>\n\n<p>During our chat at dinner I asked Keith about work.</p>\n\n<p>He said it was sucking and that he needed to find something new.</p>\n\n<p>I asked why?</p>\n\n<p>“Wordpress”</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, was his answer.  I pressed on this a bit and this is what he had to say:</p>\n\n<p>“It’s just the same thing over and over.  It pays the bills but I’m just declining.”</p>\n\n<p>He motioned a crashing plane as he said this.</p>\n\n<p>I totally get it: I, along with much (all?) of the developer world, fucking hate working in Wordpress and PHP.</p>\n\n<p>There, I said it.</p>\n\n<p>Why, you might ask, do you care?</p>\n\n<p>You care because you <em>want</em> creative people working on your awesome site.</p>\n\n<p>You care because you <em>want</em> talented developers building your awesome app.</p>\n\n<p>You care because <em>we do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When you choose a platform you don’t choose it for technology (listen to me, I’m a CTO saying this), rather, you choose it for the culture of the people attracted to it.  You choose a platform because of all the awesome people like Keith that come along with it.</p>\n\n<p>So, the next time you are building something, don’t ask yourself</p>\n\n<p>“what should I build this on”</p>\n\n<p>ask yourself</p>\n\n<p>“<em>who</em> should be building this”</p>\n\n<p>and the platform will follow as a result.</p>\n\n<p>After all, it is the <em>people</em> at the dance that really make it.</p>\n\n<p>p.s.  you may also enjoy <a href=\"/blog/static-is-the-new-black\">Static Is The New Black</a> ;-)</p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Juggling work life and parenting is an exercise in living with, and surrendering to, constant change. Read: Give into the chaos that is now your life. People often mention the phrase work/mom ‘balance.’</p>\n\n<p>I think this is a joke.</p>\n\n<p>‘Balance’ is a sometimes moment, a fleeting second when you weren’t thinking of your growing to-do list. When we are talking everyday life, the gettin’ down to brass tasks, and moving between the roles of worker and mom, we are talking pandemonium.</p>\n\n<p>Especially if one is still breastfeeding. But that’s a different blog.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I think (wish) there will be a time in the not-so-distant future when things might actually smooth over, even themselves out, and, well, that’s a lie. Because, A) I have a toddler, B) I have another baby on the way C) I work part-time. I have a partner who works full-full time. We have a good, solid, supportive community and a well-established routine, but then you get sick weeks. The toddler has been ill with cold sores, and fever, and general irritability, which means that she is a miserable creature who is glued to my leg in her waking hours.</p>\n\n<p>There is no getting into ‘balance,’ here, people. There is, however, leaning into our lives as they are - in constant flux, changing, moment to moment. No better teacher has come my way in that regard than my daughter. And, let’s face it - kids or no kids - we are all trying to escape the reality of  ‘not knowing what is going to happen next,’ so we might as well respond to our everyday as it happens. Easier said than done.</p>\n\n<p>What I know for myself: that the added chaos of being a working mother is a good thing. I’m positive it makes me a better parent. All the focus isn’t on my little one, who bless her heart, needs other people to shape her too. Sure, in the beginning there were tears (mine and hers). But I go away and come back recharged, showing up more fully from having spent time with adults who speak in full sentences.</p>\n\n<p>Working at dojo4 supports my life in the midst of the craziness. I like to think the ability for me to ‘do work from home,’ and, ‘do home from work,’ supports a life that is always in flux (sick kids, babysitter cancels, house floods, roof leaks, dentist will only see you tomorrow otherwise you will have to wait 3 months, etc.) I think there is tendency as a mother to compartmentalize our lives. My reality is that I am not separate selves throughout my day - I am mother, worker and me. At dojo4 I can bring all those things and this flexibility has been crucial in my ability to get the job done.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it’s the company attitude towards work flexibility. I work most of my hours remotely while my daughter takes her afternoon nap (thank you, oh nap gods). She and I come to the office for various duties throughout the week, and we are always met with warmth, and welcome, even when folks are in meetings with clients. No bother that the two-year old is in the next room drawing on walls (it only happened once, and I swear it came off easy-peasy). School-age kids drop by after school to say hi to a parent, and the babies take naps in the lounge while mom finishes up the last meeting of the day. Kiddos can attend Friday stand-up followed by community lunch, and mid-week yoga is open to all. The company’s adaptability to the many hats of their workers speaks volumes to the value they place on health, well-being and sanity. Navigating work and parenting ain’t for sissies, as I recently told a co-worker, but when you have a flexible, welcoming workplace, it makes all the difference.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/responding-to-the-everyday-as-it-happens/assets/rp---work.jpg' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/responding-to-the-everyday-as-it-happens/assets/corey-and-flo-at-work.JPG' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>This has been a busy year for us over here at dojo4 (e.g. we helped launched <a href=\"http://hubboulder.com/\">the Hub</a> into it’s first year, <a href=\"https://dojo4.com/blog/work-after-flo-dojo4\">I had a baby</a>, <a href=\"https://dojo4.com/team\">we made a bunch of great hires</a>, I think we launched every project we were hired to complete, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard\">Ara</a> had major back surgery, etc.) And although gratifying in many ways, it’s been hard to find space and time for many of the things I used to like to do, like photography (and sleep- hah, hah). (<a href=\"http://coreykohn.com/\">coreykohn.com</a> and <a href=\"http://pixtress.tumblr.com/\">pixtress.tumblr.com</a> are cute, but out of date and poorly kept up.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about this and realized that I have not been making use some of the best-ever tools available when feeling busy, harried and overwhelmed: being gentle with oneself and resourceful with what’s right there.</p>\n\n<p>Chogyam Trungpa had this, and more, to say on the subject: <a href=\"http://www.shambhala.com/shambhala-3.html\">“When you are fully gentle, without arrogance and without aggression, you see the brilliance of the universe. You can appreciate green, nicely shaped blades of grass, and you can appreciate a striped grasshopper with a tinge of copper color and black antennae. It is so beautiful sitting on a plant… Little things like that are not boring sights; they are new discoveries. Every day you see different things… The world is very interesting wherever you go, wherever you look.”</a></p>\n\n<p>In this case, I think gentleness means actually being who and where you are and allowing what’s happening to actually unfold. And being without aggression and arrogance means not trying to alter those things, to force any situation into being other than what it is, not trying to force it into what you may want it to be instead.</p>\n\n<p>We can be most resourceful when we acknowledge where we are at and what the world is presenting to us. And sometimes it even helps to create contraints to highlight that. We do this in relationships, on projects and in almost every aspect of our lives, by setting parameters that help us acknowledge the resources that are available to us. These parameters are what allow us to then make the most creative use of the tools we have. We do this at dojo4 by outlining the limitations of each project and then using those boundaries to exert the pressure needed to write truly robust code and design thoroughly useable applications. Constraints are our allies in the creative process. And gentleness allows us to discover great things in what we do and see every day.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, I’ve decided to embark on a mini-project of appreciating where I’m at and the resources that are available to me. This project is based on my most favorite quote about photography, by <a href=\"http://www.womeninphotography.org/ruthbernhardAA.html\">Ruth Berhard</a>: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Search-Reality-Documentary-Filmmaking/dp/0941188620\">“If you can’t find something worthy to photograph with forty feet from where you stand, you are not seeing… [It’s about] the difference between looking and seeing… You must look with eyes that are awake to the extraordinary within the ordinary. I want to capture in my photgraphs that singular moment of tenderness I see in life.”</a></p>\n\n<p>For the next month I will post a photograph every day that I am at work of something I see within 40 feet of dojo4.</p>\n\n<p>Today I saw this #within40feet:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=rhv8ea\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i39.tinypic.com/rhv8ea.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" /></a></p>\n\n</div>\n",

As a full stack developer that mainly concentrates on the front-end, it was overwhelming to come into an existing rails project with a small javascript task. What files to edit? How are my scripts included in the page? How is a request handled in rails? Ahh!!</p>\n\n<p>So I wrote a book about it. My awesome dojo4 teammates helped review it for technical soundness and I think it’s at a great point to release to the world. Hopefully it helps other front-end developers who jump into a rails project and realize they’re lost. Let this book be your compass!</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/we-wrote-a-book/assets/cover-idea-2.png' alt=\"img\" /></p>\n\n<p>Check out the book:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/rorfrontend\">In multiple e-book formats (PDF, MOBI, EPUB)</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Explained-Front-End-Developers-ebook/dp/B00HYO0PT6/\">In the Kindle store</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/miles-matthias/ruby-on-rails-explained-for-front-end-developers/paperback/product-21409160.html\">In paperback!</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Description:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">Ruby on Rails is an extremely powerful full-stack web application framework, but with its power comes complexity. For front-end developers who simply need to edit HTML, CSS, and JS within a Ruby on Rails application, it can be a daunting task. This book explains what front-end developers needs to know about Ruby on Rails in order to work their mastery within a rails app.\n\nBy the end of the book, you'll be able to:\n\n* know where to put your html, css, &amp; js within the structure of a ruby on rails app\n\n* how rails routes requests to controllers\n\n* using views, layouts, and partials in controllers\n\n* what the asset pipeline is and how to use it\n\n* how controllers and views in rails work together to render a response in the browser\n\n* how data is added to views and how to link to the data in your html\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You’ll love it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://leanpub.com/rorfrontend\">In multiple e-book formats (PDF, MOBI, EPUB)</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Explained-Front-End-Developers-ebook/dp/B00HYO0PT6/\">In the Kindle store</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/miles-matthias/ruby-on-rails-explained-for-front-end-developers/paperback/product-21409160.html\">In paperback!</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n",

      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Everybody, including your mother, has told you that you need a Content Management System (CMS). You, yourself, feel as if you need instant access to the content on your website. The truth is that, unless generating content is part of your business model (i.e. N.Y. Times or Perez Hilton), you don’t need a CMS. Furthermore, it’s likely costing you time, money, security and page rank.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"you-simply-arent-going-to-update-your-site\">You simply aren’t going to update your site</h2>\n\n<p>I know, you’re totally excited about your new website. You think that you are going to log on everyday, ok, once a week at least, to update the content. That’s a lie. Here are three things to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>You have other tasks to complete that are <em>much</em> more important to your business than updating your site, like finding customers.</li>\n  <li>If you are extremely concerned about your content (which you should be), you will hire a <em>professional</em> copywriter while you are building your site to get your message right. After that, polishing it every 4 to 6 months as the voice of your brand evolves seems appropriate.</li>\n  <li>There are other, non-cms ways to make your site feel dynamic — widgets are a prime example or pulling in content that you can update elsewhere, like a <a href=\"http://www.bourncreative.com/how-to-add-the-official-twitter-widget-to-your-website/\" title=\"Twitter Widgets\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Tumblr\">Tumblr</a> feed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"your-cms-as-a-concrete-block\">Your CMS as a concrete block</h2>\n\n<p>You are paying a really high price for the constant access that you are likely not using enough.</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing to understand is that your CMS is having to do <em>a lot</em> of work to generate pages for your visitors. This work takes time. That time not only slows down the speed at which your visitors view the page, but also negatively impacts your SEO. We don’t know everything that goes into Google’s secret sauce, but we do know that page speed is high on their list.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to know about CMSs is that they add multiple layers of vulnerabilities. In other words, there are many more points of attack for hackers to gain access and spread their nasty business around — particularly if you are using a popular CMS, like <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" title=\"WordPress\">WordPress</a> or <a href=\"https://drupal.org/\" title=\"Drupal\">Drupal</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-the-hell-do-i-do-then\">What the hell do I do then?</h2>\n\n<p>Simple - static HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We recommend <a href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\" title=\"Middleman\">Middleman</a>. Middleman is a static site generator written in Ruby. That means that we build fancy data-driven websites locally that ultimately get converted to static HTML pages and deployed anywhere… seriously, anywhere, for cheap (think S3 or BitBalloon for ~$5/mo.). This not only means that your site will be obnoxiously fast, but it will also have an uptime that pushes 100%. Think this isn’t realistic? Check out dojo4.com - a static site built in middleman and served by S3 - and we even have a blog!</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, the arguments for having a CMS-backed website are becoming fewer and fewer by the day. Be smart. Be simple. Be static.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
