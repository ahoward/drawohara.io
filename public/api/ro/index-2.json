My name is Martin Cadee and I'll be bringing a group of 6 international students (17-19)  from the United World College in Montezuma, NM, to Boulder next week. They're all part of a Social Entrepreneurship Incubator that I'm piloting there. Together with Greg Berry (<span>the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hubboulder.com/\" href=\"http://www.hubboulder.com/\">Hub</a>\r\n</span>\r\n<span><span>) and Teju Ravilochan (<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/\" href=\"http://unreasonableinstitute.org/\">Unreasonable Institute</a>) we're organizing a meet & pitch. I'm still looking for a space for that event. Greg told me you might have a space available and could be the perfect fit. </span>\r\n</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\">Warm greetings!</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\">Martin</p>\r\n<p>I'd never met Martin nor heard of the <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://uwcusaseinc.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://uwcusaseinc.wordpress.com/\">Social Entrepreneurship Incubator</a> at the UWC in New Mexico, but it turns out Martin and I know a number of people in common and it felt like a perfect fit, indeed. This is exactly the kind of thing we love to support at dojo4. Community gatherings of innovative entrepreneurs of all ages embody our thinking about the vast possibility that comes from engaging in fearless thinking and the willingness to see problems as workable opportunities. </p>\r\n<p>Less than a week after getting this email from Martin, our space if full of people from all over the world, laughing cheerfully and listening attentively as each person introduces themselves before we hear presentations from each of the 6 UWC students. We have lawyers, local business leaders, journalists, students, activists, friends and family filing every last chair, even sitting on the floor to hear the presentations that range from a proposal to open reopen a defunct library for young people in Palestine to continuing an ongoing micro-lending operation in Nigeria.And the presentations are good- unusually good.</p>\r\n<p>One of the students, Andrew Nalani from Uganda, wrapped it up by talking about the shoulders he stands on that support him in believing in himself, following his inspirations and making real breakthroughs and innovation happen. We stand there, too, and are committed to becoming these shoulders ourselves. </p>",

We're really pleased with how the project turned out. Here are some of the details:</p>\r\n<h2>A logo and brand</h2>\r\n<p>We decided to start with a logo that turns Boulder's famous Flatirons into a single awesome peak (the \"Big Boulder\", if you will). Our design hero Anthony took basic shapes from the first, second, and third Flatirons and simplified them.</p>\r\n<p>As we worked with our excellent friends Randy and Bre at GNIP, we explored different type treatments in combination with logo. The progression is evident in the image to the left, which illustrates how the final logomark came to be.</p>\r\n<h2>A website for all devices</h2>\r\n<p>We jumped right off the Big Boulder brand into site design. This was a close collaboration between Anthony and our resident HTML samurai, Steve, because we committed at the outset to make this site <strong>highly responsive</strong>. Thanks to Steve's precision bladework, the site looks great on big screens, medium screens and little screens. And, importantly, <strong>the content tapers</strong> to only the most essential items when viewed on the small screen.</p>\r\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/big-boulder-rolling/assets/bigboulder-mobile.png' title=\"Bigboulder Mobile\" alt=\"Bigboulder Mobile\" rel=\"225x255\" width=\"136\" height=\"255\" style=\"float:right\" class=\"mll mbl\" />\r\n<p>We've been using responsive grid libraries such as <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\" title=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\" title=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Bootstrap</a> in our apps for some time, so we decided to do the same with Big Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>See for yourself! For instance, compare how the site's header navigation looks on desktops with how it looks on your smartphone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A launch</h2>\r\n<p>Once we had a solid static website built, we mixed in a <a href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\" title=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\">Middleman</a>. If you build web sites and you've never seen Middleman, check it out. Middleman lets you<strong> templatize your static web site</strong>: Because <strong>it's totally crazy to maintain ten identical copies of a header and a footer</strong>. </p>\r\n<p>Middleman works with a variety of templating languages. We used ERB because we like it. That allowed us to do things like have dynamic title tags on pages, even though the HTML head is elsewhere:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<code>  \r\n  &lt;title&gt;&lt;%= (content_for?(:title)) ? yield_content(:title) : \"Big Boulder Conference\" %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\r\n</code>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Middleman also allows us to do things like minimize CSS and JavaScript, and force browsers to load new versions of CSS and JavaScript files:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<code>\r\n  &lt;link href=&quot;/stylesheets/style.css?1332972306&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;\r\n</code>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Middleman lets us put important or repetitive data in a YAML file, making the site far more maintainable than a traditional static site.</p>\r\n<div class=\"lightestgrayBg roundMd mll mtm\">\r\n  <pre>  \r\n  registration:\r\n    label: Registration Opened\r\n    description: Register outside of the Xanadu Ballroom at the St Julien Hotel and Spa\r\n  </pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Finally, we built an automated deploy to our staging and production environments (hosted on EC2). Build the site, rsync it to the server.</p>\r\n<div class=\"lightestgrayBg roundMd mll mtm\">\r\n  <pre>  \r\n  middleman build\r\n  rsync -avz ./ user@server.dojo4.com:/ebs/sites/bigboulderconference2012\r\n  </pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Now ain't that pretty?</p>\r\n</div>",

The are currently over 25 Hubs all around the world, from Copenhagen to Johannesburg, Prague to Tel Aviv serving over 4000 members in the endeavors as entrepreneurs and changemakers. </p>\r\n<p>One reason we've been excited to sponsor this project and sit on the board to help get it going, is that we recognize that Boulder is <em>already</em> a hub. Boulder is a hub for entrepreneurs, innovators and startups that are driven by a passion to see things differently and to use that vision for the betterment of this world of ours. We know this because we have these changemakers walk through our doors every day. We build and design technology for them. We drink beer with them on Friday afternoons. We see them hatch ideas and run with them. We are proud to be in their company and count ourselves among them. </p>\r\n<p>And now Boulder will have a place for housing this energy that is so vibrant here. The Hub is a co-working space, but it is also a meeting place, an event venue, a training ground, an incubator, a mentoring platform and an international network. It's a place for people to connect and use those connections to grow their social ventures and world-changing endeavors. </p>\r\n<p>The Hub will open in downtown Boulder in September.

      "body": "<p><em>This was crossposted over at the <a href=\"http://www.npcultivationcenter.org/uncategorized/when-it-comes-to-technology-if-it-isnt-broke-dont-fix-it-if-it-is-throw-it-out-the-window/\" title=\"http://www.npcultivationcenter.org/uncategorized/when-it-comes-to-technology-if-it-isnt-broke-dont-fix-it-if-it-is-throw-it-out-the-window/\">Boulder Nonprofit Cultivation Center</a>.</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I work for a little technology company in Boulder called dojo4. Many of dojo4's customers have tight budgets and long wish lists. They almost always have to make trade-offs between competing priorities, leaving lots of important work for another time. The cost of buying or building new technology is a huge hurdle for them.</p>\r\n<p>I know what you're thinking: dojo4 must work with a lot of nonprofits, right?</p>\r\n<p>Well, sometimes we do. But I'm actually talking about technology startups. They hire dojo4 to help them turn their ambitious ideas into products and services on the internet. Most of them face many of the same challenges nonprofits encounter when it comes to technology:</p>\r\n<ul><li>It's hard to know what technology investments are most important.</li>\r\n<li>It's impossible to keep up with technology's rapid changes when your real focus is on a service, a population or a product.</li>\r\n<li>It's challenging to find good technical partners.</li>\r\n<li>Technology is expensive!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Of course there are plenty of differences between startups and nonprofits&mdash;too many to list here. But one difference is worth examining: Unlike many established nonprofits, most technology startups are agile to a fault. Their requirements, circumstances, missions and staff change rapidly and often. Letting go of technologies that aren't working is one way that startups deliver maximum return on funders' investments.</p>\r\n<p>Consider this in the context of your nonprofit:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Do your specialized, non-technical staff spend their days fighting with technology? </li>\r\n<li>Does your website always need expensive fixing? </li>\r\n<li>Does your Microsoft Exchange server sometimes seem to get more attention than your constituents? </li>\r\n<li>How do all these secondary concerns affect your ability to deliver your core service?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If this sounds familiar, maybe you can take a page out of the startup playbook: Just push that Exchange server out a window. It'll feel good if nothing else.</p>\r\n<p class=\"txtC\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/60258236@N02/5515327431/\" title=\"Server028 by Am + Mo, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5012/5515327431_ac7d075565.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Server028\" /></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I know it may not be quite that easy. But you <em>can</em> let go of some nonessential technological baggage. You <em>can</em> make technology choices that increase your agility. You <em>can</em> solve your own technology problems.</p>\r\n<p>But how do you start? Come to the<a href=\"http://www.npcultivationcenter.org/events/technology-summit-2012/\" title=\"http://www.npcultivationcenter.org/events/technology-summit-2012/\"> Nonprofit Cultivation Center's annual Technology Summit</a> on June 19th! <strong>dojo4 is sponsoring this event</strong> because we believe it represents a unique opportunity for Boulder's nonprofits to team up with Boulder's vibrant technology community, to work together on issues that matter to us all.</p>\r\n<p>The modern internet offers a wealth of new tools to help your nonprofit focus on its mission. And the internet also supports an awesome culture of generosity and innovation. We've never had so many great tools at our fingertips. It's never been so easy to discover people who care about the same things you care about. It's never been so easy to contribute to something important!</p>\r\n<figure class=\"mbl mtl txtC\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/push-it-out-the-window/assets/afe45c566c9b11e19e4a12313813ffc0-7.jpg' title=\"Afe45c566c9b11e19e4a12313813ffc0 7\" alt=\"Afe45c566c9b11e19e4a12313813ffc0 7\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /><figcaption>dojo4 hosts international high-school student entrepreneurs (March 2012)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>New technologies present incredible opportunities, but passionate people realize them.

Joanna and Mark first worked on massaging the content from the marketing site into the web app's landing page, using wireframes to place content into discrete buckets. Their clear copy explains how easy it is for folks to use InspirePay to start taking payments.</p>\n\n<p>Next,&#160;<a href=\"/#anthony\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Dimitre</a>, resident design wizard at dojo4, turned the content map into an elegant, well-designed web page:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl mrl\">\n<img src='/ro/dojo4/how-to-fold-a-marketing-site-into-a-web-app/assets/inspirepay-new-design.png' title=\"Inspirepay New Design\" alt=\"Inspirepay New Design\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" />\n<figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\" style=\"text-align:center;\">The redesigned page describes the product and instructs the user</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>With page designs in hand we moved into implementation. In this case that meant replacing a siloed instance of Wordpress with static pages in the application itself. Serving marketing content from the same container as InspirePay's payment processing application required dojo4 to ensure all assets and 3rd-party embeds were transmitted securely across https. We also integrated the application's authentication into the static page.</p>\n<p>Now from the landing page alone, visitors can learn about the product, get a sense of how it works, and sign up to use it. One-stop shopping!</p>\n\n<p>See for yourself: <a href=\"https://inspirepay.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://inspirepay.com</a>.</p>\n\n</div>",

It hung behind dojo4 for just two nights.</p>\n<p>We thought the story was over, and we hoped it generated some fun for the <a href=\"http://photograffitiboulder.wordpress.com/about/\" title=\"http://photograffitiboulder.wordpress.com/about/\">artist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org/\" title=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org/\">sponsor</a> behind the project. But it hasn't ended.</p>\n<p>This morning while a few of us were down at <a href=\"http://boxcarcoffeeroasters.com/\" title=\"http://boxcarcoffeeroasters.com/\">Boxcar Coffee</a>, a Boulder Open Space ranger drove up to dojo4 and left something on the porch. The Ruby hackers hanging out saw it happen, and they took the unexpected delivery inside.</p>\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/a-sequel/assets/img-20120418-090402.jpg' title=\"Img 20120418 090402\" alt=\"Img 20120418 090402\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p>Those are the facts. Beyond them is merely conjecture.

It appears we \"stole\" it using pure hacker guile: We're the only entity associated with this project whose address can be easily found online, and for some searches we're the first result. Talk about black-hat SEO!</p>\n<p>The placard remains, so we cannot guarantee this piece will not follow the first one into an unknown private collection.

The event used <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_meeting\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_meeting\">open space technology</a> to engage the question: <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Game\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Game\">Can we design a world that is workable for 100% of humanity?</a> As a presenter, dojo4 was asked to bring a \"<a title=\"http://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/the-power-of-provocation/\" href=\"http://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/the-power-of-provocation/\">provocation</a>\" that would address one model or practice that we believe is revolutionizing our work and contributing to a better world.</p>\r\n<p>Hmm, good question! And provocative indeed! I talked to the partners here about it and what easily floated to the top as the most crucial practices we believe are revolutionizing our work and contributing to a better world are: Do Something Simple First and Listen Deeply.</p>\r\n<p>And so this is what I offered as a provocation at the ShareLab:</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"1 Do Something Simple First\" title=\"1 Do Something Simple First\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/1-dosomethingsimplefirst.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p>People often say that at dojo4 we design and build software for the internet. But that's not actually what we do. What we do is help solve problems for people. Most often we use technology and design as tools for engaging these problems. But really, the most cogent way to describe what we do is that we help solve problems for people by doing something simple first.</p>\r\n<p>Let me break down what I mean by that...</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"2 Do\" title=\"2 Do\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/2-do.jpg' height=\"255\" width=\"205\" /></p>\r\n<p>First of all: do! That means taking a can-do attitude. It doesn't mean sit around and think about it for another week. It means approaching problems with a sense of achieving something. So the next question is what is this \"something\"?</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"http://xkcd.com/974/\" href=\"http://xkcd.com/974/\"><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"3 Pass The Salt\" title=\"3 Pass The Salt\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/3-passthesalt.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></a>\r\n<br />\"Something\" is probably what's right in front of you. It's the thing that's needed right now. For instance, a prospective client walks into dojo4 with this problem: \"We don't have the salt and we want the salt.\" At that point, \"do something\" is passing them the salt. We don't need to build them a catapult for vaulting the salt over to their side of the table and we don't need to develop an algorithm for how long it will take to get the salt to them by various methods of salt passing. What we need to do is use the most basic tools to get them the salt, which is most likely going to mean using our hands and arm muscles to push the salt across to them.</p>\r\n<p>We pass the salt in the most basic way possible, being sure not to elaborate unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html\" href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html\"><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"4 Einstein\" title=\"4 Einstein\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/4-einstein.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br />Doing something truly simple is the most powerful and elegant work we do. And so this is always the first approach to take.</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"5 First\" title=\"5 First\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/5-first.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />Avoiding getting lost in the maze, by taking the most straightforward and simple path first, underlies one of the principles of software engineering that serves us well: the steel thread. <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_thread\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_thread\">A steel thread indicates the most important path of execution in a computer system.</a> It focuses on only on what is fundamental to a system and shuns added or auxiliary possibilities and uses.</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"6 Steel Thread\" title=\"6 Steel Thread\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/6-steelthread.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />By doing something simple first we are able to draw the most sturdy steel thread through from the inception of a problem, or entry to a system, all the way to its solution or conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>What we've found is that the system that underlies all the technical and design problems that we encounter is the interrelation of people. The essential system is a human framework. And we've found that the first thing we can do simply in this system is to try to understand each other more clearly.</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"7 Understanding People\" title=\"7 Understanding People\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/7-understandingpeople.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />A steel thread that we can draw through the problems that arise in the human system is to try to understand people better. And in order to understand clients and users better, we have to understand ourselves and each other better. Unquestionably, this approach has the potential of spinning off many beneficial results, but at the very least it allows us to design and build better web applications.</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"8 Understanding=Better\" title=\"8 Understanding=Better\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/8-understanding-better.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p>One of the practices or tools that we use at dojo4 to understand ourselves and each other better is to have <a title=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/a-bow-and-a-clap\" href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/a-bow-and-a-clap\">a weekly standup</a> that cultivates our ability to ask compelling questions and to listen deeply. We take turns asking one <a title=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23dj4standup\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/search/realtime/%23dj4standup\">question</a> every week that might allow us to understand ourselves and each other better, and refines our capacity for actually, really listening.</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"9 Standup\" title=\"9 Standup\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/9-standup.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>We use a loose <a title=\"http://www.artofhosting.org/thepractice/coremethods/circlepractise/\" href=\"http://www.artofhosting.org/thepractice/coremethods/circlepractise/\">circle practice</a> as this tool, but there are many methods and practices that do the trick. The main point is that we've found that it's important to core of our business and our work in the world to understand people better. And we can best do this by sticking to two related fundamentals: do something simple first and listen deeply.</p>\r\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"10 Do Something Simple First\" title=\"10 Do Something Simple First\" src='/ro/dojo4/toolbox-for-a-better-world-do-something-simple-first-listen-deeply/assets/10-dosomethingsimplefirst.jpg' height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This thanks to <a title=\"http://codeforpeople.com/\" href=\"http://codeforpeople.com/\">Ara</a> and <a title=\"https://twitter.com/#!/hoosteeno\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/hoosteeno\">Justin</a> and my other cohorts at dojo4 for conversations about what we can do and already do to make a better world.</em>\r\n</p>",

Despite (or maybe because of) the move, the turnout persisted in being phenomenal and included a whole range of folk, from those who already died-hard members of the Hub to those who came just to find out more. <span><a title=\"http://www.impactassets.org/about-us/team/timothy-freundlich/\" href=\"http://www.impactassets.org/about-us/team/timothy-freundlich/\">Tim Freundlich</a>\n</span> was on hand to talk about <a title=\"hhttp://hub-ventures.com/\" href=\"hhttp://hub-ventures.com/\">Hub Ventures</a>' support for Hub Boulder and the vision for the next ten years  of having <a title=\"http://www.the-hub.net/\" href=\"http://www.the-hub.net/\">Hubs</a> in every <a title=\"http://www.the-hub.net/network\" href=\"http://www.the-hub.net/network\">major metropolitan city in the world</a> with a membership of over 2 million change-makers, social innovators, and entrepreneurs cultivating the common good.

I don’t get to see them that much.</p>\n\n<p>This morning I helped them find a great hike to do in the area at Hall Ranch ( <a href=\"http://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/hall-ranch.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/hall-ranch.html</a> ) which is about 20 miles away in a town called Lyons.  My folks had never been there so my mother asked me for directions.  My dad has an iPhone and showed just how cool it is to be able to do a search in maps and get directions just like that - technology to the rescue!</p>\n\n<p>On the way to work I had a bit of a bad feeling: did I really just help my mom?  Instead of showing her how to use some neat-o bit of technology I could have just taken 30 seconds to give her directions.  Why didn’t I?</p>\n\n<p>Technology is here to help us.  It’s a tool to make our lives easier and happier.  Right?</p>\n\n<p>Wrong.  Technology is just a tool, like any other - it’s the relationship to it’s user that makes it helpful or harmful.  If we assume for a minute, that what makes people happy is their relationships with other people (a safe assumption - <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/thisemotionallife/topic/connecting/connection-happiness\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pbs.org/thisemotionallife/topic/connecting/connection-happiness</a>) then any application that actually reduces human connection may <em>not be helpful</em> in the long term.</p>\n\n<p>It’s true, being able to pull up a map when you are alone and lost is truly helpful.  But <em>actually talking</em> to your son, or even a stranger, instead of using an ‘app’ when you need directions is undoubted a more profound experience for both people.</p>\n\n<p>Does your technology promote self reliance and less human interaction?</p>\n\n<p>If so, it’s at risk of being actually harmful to people - regardless of how much it might help the individual in that moment.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

He regularly triumphs over endurance races of over 100 miles. He's been called one of the best runners of all time. He's been called crazy. We call him a pleasure to work with!</p>\r\n<p>Scott came to us to rebuild <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://scottjurek.com\" href=\"http://scottjurek.com\">his site</a> and burnish his brand in time for the release of his new book, <em>Eat and Run<a title=\"http://scottjurek.com/eatandrun/\" href=\"http://scottjurek.com/eatandrun/\"></a>\r\n</em>. His affability, patience and attention to detail guided us in implementing crucial design details and making a site on which we were proud to have had 4,969 hits on the first day after launch. </p>\r\n<p>Scott's passion for aesthetics and functionality gave us the challenges we needed to build a truly gorgeous site. In terms of design, we explored a subtle logo mark and type treatment.  We chose Open Sans and Open Sans Condensed as the sites typeface which proved to be very versatile. And we had fun exploring worn textured papers backgrounds and brown color tones to express the site's travel journal feel.</p>\r\n<p>The design was translated into code with many layers and textures in the mockups, making semantic code and responsive design quite difficult and satisfying to accomplish. We're glad we've made responsive design just part of what we do here at dojo4, even when clients don't ask for it up front. About 25-30% of Scott's initial visitors have been using tablets or mobile devices. By not having to go back and retrofit, we saved substantial time and budget.</p>\r\n<p>We've also been tremendously pleased with the Middleman App, a static site generator based on Sinatra (http://middlemanapp.com/). It allows us to \"templatize\" websites (using ERB & SASS) and leverage data structures with loops to handle repetitive tasks just as WordPress, Drupal, etc. do. Middleman's advantage, however, lies in its ability to spit out a static site, making the end product faster and unhackable (sorry bad guys).</p>\r\n<p>Since we wanted Scott to be able to update content regularly, Justin wrote a sweet jQuery plugin that \"injects\" Tumblr posts in several places across the site (<a title=\"https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_tumblr\" href=\"https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_tumblr\">https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_tumblr</a>). So, despite having a static website, Scott still has fresh, timely content.</p>\r\n<p>We're glad to have had the opportunity to collaborate with Scott and support the release of his <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hmhbooks.com/books/buybooks.html?isbn13=9780547569659&isbn10=0547569653\" href=\"http://www.hmhbooks.com/books/buybooks.html?isbn13=9780547569659&isbn10=0547569653\">new book</a>. Scott's now on tour to promote his book with <a title=\"http://scottjurek.com/calendar/\" href=\"http://scottjurek.com/calendar/\">lots of running events</a> around the country - if you get the chance, it's well with dropping by and meeting Scott when he's in your town...</p>\r\n<p><em>post by Anthony, Corey and Steve</em>\r\n</p>\r\n",

Ellen's budget and needs were both small, so we decided to build a quick one-page site showcasing all her content.</p>\n<p>Ellen's design inspirations included several culinary blogs with big, beautiful pictures of food. Anthony Dimitre brought that bold look into the page with a couple very nice carrots. </p>\n<p>Anthony also put together a nice logo that will flavor all of Planted Nutrition's other materials -- business cards, client packets, and more.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Planted Nutrition is a static web site built with <a title=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\" href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\">Middleman</a>. We can't say enough about this tool. Static site generation isn't new, and Middleman isn't the first static site generator, but it is a <em>very good</em> tool. </p>\n<p>At dojo4 we're using Middleman as an alternative to the ubiquitous LAMP content management systems. There are several good LAMP CMS tools out there, but they aren't one-size-fits-all, and they all require some trade-offs. In this case, even a CMS as simple as Wordpress would be too complex and maintenance-heavy for Planted Nutrition's immediate needs.</p>\n<p>Someday, Planted Nutrition may want something more than a static site. But meanwhile, this tasty site is plenty. </p>\n</div>\n",

This means Foundation 3 offers <strong>no support for IE7</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Bootstrap also reverts to the traditional box model for its <code class=\"lightestgrayBg\">row-fluid</code> layouts, adjusting widths and margins using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter#Star_hack\" target=\"_blank\">star hack</a> to allow for IE7 support. But its fixed layouts still use the W3C model.</p>\r\n<p>Personally, I'm a big fan of the box model reset strategy, and I know our backend team would be thrilled&mdash;when they drop content into views, they use tables just to avoid all the arcana surrounding the W3C model. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug#Background\" target=\"_blank\">traditional box model</a> just makes sense.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, I'm excited by the prospect of developers&mdash;specifically, those who contribute to CSS frameworks&mdash;having a hand in shaping the supported browser landscape. As nice as it's been to have <a href=\"http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/06/our-plans-to-support-modern-browsers.html\" target=\"_blank\">major tech companies</a> take an interest in this landscape, it's even better for us to take ownership of it.</p>",

      "author": "steve@dojo4.com",
      "body": "    <p>Recently, while helping a client mark up a <a href=\"http://shopify.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a> theme, I came across a thorny problem: how to merge the output of one loop with that of another in a seamless fashion. Allow me to explain.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Most Shopify themes include a \"collection template\" where products are listed via a <a href=\"http://wiki.shopify.com/UsingLiquid\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid</a> loop. <a href=\"#figure1\">Figure 1</a> shows how such lists often take shape.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <figure id=\"figure1\" class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/eventually-all-products-merge-into-one-and-a-list-runs-through-it/assets/mockup.png' title=\"Mockup\" alt=\"Mockup\" /><figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\">\r\n        <strong><em>Figure 1</em>\r\n</strong>: A typical Shopify product listing\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n      If you're not averse to using <code>TABLEs</code> for such layouts, Liquid has you covered with its <code>TABLEROW</code> tag (<a href=\"http://wiki.shopify.com/UsingLiquid#Tables\">reference</a>). If grid-systems are more your speed, you'll want to employ some kind of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2245972/modulus-or-lack-thereof-in-rubys-liquid-templating-engine/8439160#8439160\" target=\"_blank\">row wrapping hack</a>, since Liquid doesn't have an <code>each_slice()</code> enumerator or <code>modulus</code> operator.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      But if you, like me, think the semantically appropriate markup for a product <strong>list</strong> is an unordered list (<code>UL</code>), you're committed to working with a stream of <code>LIs</code>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      As I mentioned above, this design required that a list of product collections appear inline with the list of products, but not just anywhere. It was supposed to be the third item in the first row, as shown in <a href=\"#figure2\">Figure 2</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <figure id=\"figure2\" class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n      <img src='/ro/dojo4/eventually-all-products-merge-into-one-and-a-list-runs-through-it/assets/desired-layout.png' title=\"Desired Layout\" alt=\"Desired Layout\" />\r\n      <figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n        <strong><em>Figure 2</em>\r\n</strong>: A product listing loop ostensibly interrupted by a navigation list\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Now, I didn't want to start one loop, stop it, start another, stop it, then start the first one again with an appropriate offset. That seemed too manual. Again, I wanted the output to be a stream of <code>LIs</code> like so:\r\n    </p>\r\n      <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/icegulch/8373741.js\"></script>\r\n    <p>\r\n      So, that left me with two choices for laying out this stream of <code>LIs</code>: floating and clearing them or inline-blocking them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      It's easy enough to imagine how you could achieve the desired layout with floats, floating each <code>LI</code> left, except for the first one, which would be floated right. But the floating option requires careful clearing—both the <code>UL</code> itself and every third <code>LI</code> (starting with the first) must be cleared in order to avoid the problem revealed in <a href=\"#figure3\">Figure 3</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <figure id=\"figure3\" class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n      <img src='/ro/dojo4/eventually-all-products-merge-into-one-and-a-list-runs-through-it/assets/float-issue.png' title=\"Float Issue\" alt=\"Float Issue\" />\r\n      <figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n        <strong><em>Figure 3</em>\r\n</strong>: When the first LI in each \"row\" isn't cleared...\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Liquid's <code>CYCLE</code> tag (<a href=\"http://wiki.shopify.com/UsingLiquid#Cycle\">reference</a>) is a handy way of doing this, as is CSS3's <a href=\"http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoclass-nthchild\" target=\"_blank\">positional pseudo selectors</a>. But, when IE7/IE8 support is required, cycling's the better bet.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Still, this house of clearing cards felt brittle to me, so I endeavored to put the aforementioned inline-block listing techinque to work. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/icegulch/8373784.js\"></script>\r\n    <p>\r\n       Which got me most of the way there, as <strong>Figure 4</strong> demonstrates.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <figure id=\"figure4\" class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n      <img src='/ro/dojo4/eventually-all-products-merge-into-one-and-a-list-runs-through-it/assets/initial-inline-block.png' title=\"Initial Inline Block\" alt=\"Initial Inline Block\" />\r\n      <figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n        <strong><em>Figure 4</em>\r\n</strong>: First crack at inline-block layout\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Though the inline-block technique freed me of clearing concerns, I still had to contend with the positioning challenge of the design: the product navigation list was supposed to be flush right in the first row. Floating it to the right wasn't the answer either, as that would subject our layout to the same risk shown in <a href=\"#figure3\">Figure 3</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      That's when I had a crazy idea: what if I changed the language direction of the <code>UL</code> so that the list would display right to left? Emboldened by a <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/star-ratings/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Chris Coyier article</a>, I decided to give it a whirl. Here's what I ultimately came up with:\r\n    </p>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/icegulch/8373820.js\"></script>\r\n<p>\r\n      As you can see, I had to change the language direction on the containing <code>UL</code>, then reset it on elements within its <code>LIs</code> (for some reason, reseting the language direction on the <code>LIs</code> themselves didn't work in Opera). I also had to set the font size on the <code>UL</code> to zero in order <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/\" target=\"_blank\">to avoid this</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Since the listing of products in this store didn't require specific ordering (alphabetical, price, etc), it was okay for the output to flow right to left, as shown in <a href=\"#figure5\">Figure 5</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <figure id=\"figure5\" class=\"pal lightestgrayBg mvl\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n      <img src='/ro/dojo4/eventually-all-products-merge-into-one-and-a-list-runs-through-it/assets/inline-block-final.png' title=\"Inline Block Final\" alt=\"Inline Block Final\" />\r\n      <figcaption class=\"mtm fontItalic\" style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n        <strong><em>Figure 5</em>\r\n</strong>: the language direction switch in action\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    </figure>\r\n    <p>\r\n      While there are pros and cons to both floated and inline-blocked layouts, I thought the latter was a little more elegant in this situation. Have any of you run across this? Are you <a href=\"http://youtu.be/ATKQLgi5Z2Y\" target=\"_blank\">haunted by</a> lists?\r\n    </p>",

However, it leaves alot\nof thinking for the developer to do regarding best practices for modeling your jobs, managing\ndeployments, and managing worker processes.  Following is a set of best\npractices for using resque/redis as your background job system.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"managing-the-background-processes\">Managing The Background Processes</h2>\n\n<p>Resque has some facilities for managing background processes, but they are\ncruftly and buggy.  We use this simple wrapper script to manage a single\ninstance of the background job daemon:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3123756.js?file=jobs.rb\"></script>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"modeling-your-jobs\">Modeling Your Jobs</h2>\n\n<p>One of the first thing to do is to determine how to model your jobs.  Resque\nmakes is pretty simple to submit arbitrary methods on modules, but we prefer\ndoing something a little more sanitary.  In particular we like having ids on\njobs, being able to query them easily, and making them uber durable in the\nface of system or process failures.  By simply consolodating all job logic\ninto a single model that shadows the resque job this is quite possible.  Here\nis our base job class.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3123839.js?file=job.rb\"></script>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>As you can probably see, this class (which could easily be ported to ActiveRecord) allows submission of arbitrary jobs,\nmailer or otherwise, and each job leaves a turd in the main database that ties\nit to the resque/redis entry.  It makes working with jobs objects extremely natural  - for instance having a polling loop check the status of a particular job by id, or getting a quick count of how may jobs have succeeded in the last week.  It also keeps our resque install super vanilla - we don’t use any plugins - and makes it possible to drop in another background processing system in a matter of minutes.\nAbout the only management it needs is a periodic task to to clean out the job\ncollection/table.  We use whenever( <a href=\"https://github.com/javan/whenever/\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/javan/whenever/</a> ) plus a rake\ntask to accomplish this:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3123860.js?file=jobs.rake\"></script>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3123860.js?file=schedule.rb\"></script>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"deployment\">Deployment</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, your deployment needs to keep things going:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3123860.js?file=Capfile.rb\"></script>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n</div>\n",

Add to this multi-tennancy, configs for third party integrations like facebook auth or salesforce, configs for cloud storage and content distribution networks, continuous integration environments, multi-client theming, SSL configs, vhost configs, build processes configs for js frontends, background task configuration, upload processing configuration, the list goes on… combinatorial explosion.</p>\n\n<p>At dojo4 we have a rails based web app stack and we use Multistage Capistrano for deployment to AWS EC2 nodes.  We’ve found a simple strategy for managing the large variety of config and deployment requirements that our clients have presented us with.  The strategy involves a rake task which uses a RAILS_STAGE environment variable based on the Capistrano Multistage stage.  We setup a file structure for deployment specific configs in repo_root/config/deploy/files/RAILS_STAGE which is structured identically to the source repo file system.  During cap deploy, before current symlink or build processes, the rake task recursively copies repo_root/config/deploy/files/RAILS_STAGE into repo_root.</p>\n\n<p>We have found this strategy to very effectively keep complex deployment configurations cleanly organized in a way which is easy to reason about and doesn’t add much additional complexity to an already complex architecture.</p>\n\n<p>The gist below demonstrates this idea.  Originally, this task leveraged various rails libraries.  However, I was able to factor out the rails dependencies while maintaining the tasks functionality so you can use it with any application stack.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3286971.js?file=jobs.rb\"></script>\n\n\n</div>\n",

It presents a potentially substantial financial cost for us as a small business, but the value fostered by supporting each other and our families, contributes indispensably to our human capital and long-term profits.&#160;</p>\n<p>In researching the particulars of what to offer as a robust parental leave policy, we found that there were very few examples out there to use as models for small businesses like ours. So after talking to lots of people and settling on a policy that we feel is supportive to both employees and the sustainability of the business, we decided to open source the policy so that organizations in the same boat can use it a template for their own parental leave policy. It's <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dojo4/policy\" href=\"https://github.com/dojo4/policy\">released to the public on github</a>. Please use whatever there that is useful (actually, the whole dojo4 HR handbook we cooked up is there, too, as open source material)- and we hope it inspires more and more of us to offer a support for employees that is really more of a right to security than an employee benefit, anyway... </p>\n<p><em>image credit: <a title=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/05/24/489973/paid-maternity-leave-us/?mobile=nc\" href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/05/24/489973/paid-maternity-leave-us/?mobile=nc\">thinkprogress.org</a>\n</em>\n</p>\n",

But even if you're not a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/\">billionaire mayor</a> or a <a href=\"#\">celebrity BBQ sauce taster</a> (OK, I totally made up that part), you probably should learn some coding skills. Below I offer six good reasons to try. </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3660/3345387692_909b4db4d6.jpg\" alt=\"Open Pit Barbeque Sauce, 1970's by Roadsidepictures, on Flickr\" class=\"imgRgt mll mbl\" height=\"500\" width=\"214\" />\r\n\r\n<p>First, let's be clear about terminology:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> For the purpose of this article, I mean the same thing when I say \"coder\", \"developer\", \"hacker\", or \"programmer\". It's big fun to divide all software makers into subtly different teams and then encourage them to face off against one another, but that's not what I'm doing right now. </li>\r\n<li> When I say \"code\", \"develop\", \"hack\" or \"program\", I really just mean, \"create coded instructions that a computer can interpret to produce some result.\" Computers are machines that implement logical instructions. Coders write the instructions in code. </li>\r\n<li> When I say \"coders write the instructions,\" I mean they use a keyboard, not a mouse. Coders don't drag & drop code. Coders do <em>write</em> drag & drop code, though. Sometimes in drag.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we're talking about the same thing, here are six reasons you should learn to code.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>REASON 1: If you learn to code, you will be a better communicator in the future.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some autumn day in 2020, you will find yourself feeling a little chilly despite the full body silver spandex suit you're wearing. So you will say something out loud like, \"Hey house, please turn up the heat three degrees.\" Then a computer will make the thermostat in your house rise by three degrees. But if, instead of that, you said, \"Dang, it's cold enough in here to freeze the fuzz off a snow weasel,\" your house would definitely pretend it didn't hear you. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will soon interact with computers using a variety of inputs besides mice and keyboards, including the spoken word. But in the near future when we speak to computers, we will have to speak to them in a dialect they can understand, just as we speak to children and dogs and our bosses using special vocabularies. And learning to code will make you much more fluent in this dialect. </p>\r\n\r\n<img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Cheddar Drone 03\" title=\"Cheddar Drone 03\" src='/ro/dojo4/you-should-learn-to-code/assets/cheddar-drone-03.jpg' class=\"imgRgt mll mtl mbl\" height=\"299\" width=\"399\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Lest you fret: A day will also come when computers understand the part about the snow weasels. But the road to that bright horizon is paved with a lot of zany mishaps. Meanwhile, learning to talk and think like a computer will grant you power and convenience you only dream of now. And in the distant future it will enable you to pilot a cheddar drone using only your mind!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>REASON 2: If you learn to code, you will make cool new friends!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people on the internet are not coders. But if Facebook came down with a debilitating case of tyrotoxism or something and fell off the internet, most of the remaining people online would be coders. Many would be fairly pleased, too. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, a whole lot of people on the internet are coders and many of them <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\">spend a lot of time helping each other</a> learn stuff. They're usually smart and nice. And despite stereotypes to the contrary, most coders are also pretty hip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You think I'm joking? Imagine a group of people who are so passionate about their work that they do it on the weekends, too, and then give the fruit of their efforts away for free to anyone in the world. Most coders consider this standard procedure. They do it because they love it and the community expects it of them. It is their way of influencing history. Like <a href=\"http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/manifesto.html\">artists</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, imagine you are trying to learn to code and you run into a problem. If you diligently attempt to resolve it through reading and experimenting and you still can't solve it, and then you ask for assistance in an online forum of coders, you will almost always get a friendly, helpful, and downright generous response from someone you've never met whose time is worth a lot of money. If you participate and contribute to the community, you may even befriend or become such a person. You thereby join a global fellowship of coders and will eventually receive by post a discreet, mysterious book of rites.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img class=\"imgRgt mll mtl mbl\" src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6039/6341791720_95796c2a53.jpg\" alt=\"leave the area leave the area by dno1967b, on Flickr\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if you don't try to resolve your coding problems yourself and instead ask straightaway for help, you will be roundly ridiculed. Kind of like if you asked a bunch of artists how to operate a can of spraypaint. The artists would scoff and say, \"RTFC, man!\", which is short for \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM\">read the effing canister</a>\".</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>REASON 3: Adventure, fortune and freedom await you!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no question that computer programming is a lucrative occupation for many people who are good at it and also for many who are not. As of this writing, a senior Ruby on Rails coder can make about fifty thousand dollars per hour. So if you like money or the things money can buy, you might want to get a job as a coder. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, you may not care about money, in which case would you mind <a href=\"https://inspirepay.com/pay/justincrawford/4.50\">buying me a beer</a>? Thanks. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>That link you just clicked goes to InspirePay, a payment startup founded by Mark Fischer. Mark charges nothing for the service -- so, since you're buying, do you mind <a href=\"https://inspirepay.com/pay/mark/4.50\">getting him a pint too</a>? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many software entrepreneurs, Mark seems to be motivated in part by the sheer adventure of it. The world is stacked a mile deep in problems that software can solve but has not already solved. These problems will occupy software innovators for decades to come. Entrepreneurs like Mark are like early pioneers crossing the tall grass prairie, like legendary cattlemen on the high desert, like the first gold miners in the Sierras. They see the promise of adventure and they accept. They go first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning to code gives you a gleaming toolkit to carry into this vast new frontier, a frontier where you will find countless opportunities to make a fortune and take wild risks. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? I'll drink to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>REASON 4: If you learn to code, you can kill a lot of birds with one stone. More than two birds, anyway.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a friend who runs a software development firm similar to dojo4, except his company works primarily with the PHP programming language instead of the Ruby programming language. He doesn't pronounce PHP as \"fup\", but I do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most software development firms get a lot of inquiries, and a fraction of these inquiries turn into service contracts. Along the way a firm often produces a proposal describing the work contemplated. This is a challenge: Proposal writing is repetitive, time consuming, and often fruitless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So my friend wants to automate his ideal proposal generation process with a web application. He's hacking on it nights and weekends using the <a href=\"http://laravel.com/\">laravel framework</a>. Plenty of technology service companies do <a href=\"http://usestacks.com/\">this kind of thing</a>; <a href=\"http://www.freshbooks.com/about.php?header_about=1\">some even make a business out of it it</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he's done, my friend will have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A tool that satisfies his own business need, making his sales process more efficient and fun.</li>\r\n<li> A software product that he can either give away to generate goodwill, or sell to generate revenue, or both.</li>\r\n<li>Launch experience (which is the best kind) with a new coding framework (laravel) that he's A) been looking for an excuse to work with and B) would eventually like to offer as a service to his customers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"imgRgt mll mtl mbl\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2288/1816927058_2a822acc25.jpg\" alt=\"Big Scary Bird by anna_debenham, on Flickr\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" />\r\n\r\n<p>That is at least three dead birds; it could be more depending on how you count. So if you hate birds or something, now's your chance to do something about it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>REASON 5: You have everything you need to start coding.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Computer programming is a difficult occupation, no doubt about it. But it does not take any more smarts than being an actuary or an attorney. It is probably less stressful than being a paramedic or a stockbroker. And it involves practically zero large predators, unlike zookeeping. Coding is mathematical and conceptual, abstract and very dynamic, and it is not for everyone. But look, you're already on REASON #5 of a long and irritating six-reason blog post. You clearly have the most important characteristic of a good coder: <del>speed-reading</del> <del>focus</del> <del>patience</del> interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you reading this on a computer that is sometimes connected to the internet? If not -- if you're reading this in print -- I'd like to thank you. I've always wanted to be published on paper. It's really, like, <em>flammable</em>, you know? Do you mind lighting a corner of it on fire right now? Yeah baby. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you're truly interested in coding and you have a computer that is sometimes connected to the internet, then you have everything that most people who code ever had when they started. Most of them didn't have computer science training. Many of them didn't have college degrees at all, or even high school diplomas. All good coders are self-taught to some extent. With your computer and your interest, you can do just what they do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a title=\"http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/\" href=\"http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/\">Build a development environment</a> -- a sandbox where you can fling computer code around without harming other things on your computer that you care about. For example, you wouldn't want to damage those blurry photos of enchiladas you took during that road trip to Tucson.</li>\r\n<li>Try and make something simple in code, starting from a tutorial online or from a crazy vision in your head. </li>\r\n<li>Make lots of mistakes on the way, but who cares? You're in the sandbox!</li>\r\n<li>Read lots of documentation online.</li>\r\n<li>Maybe ask some questions online, explaining that you already read the documentation.</li>\r\n<li>Repeat these steps for a while, and do it again every time you want to learn something new.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, you can learn to code no matter who you are. Everybody starts somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>REASON 6: The world needs more people who understand, care about, and can make things with the raw materials of our brave new society.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This cannot be overstated: Humanity has experienced only a few inflection points as important as the one that makes it possible for me to say this to you right now. No matter how you feel about the media, smartphones, blogs, Facebook, the internet or computers, you must understand that they are radically, rapidly transforming culture and society in every direction at once. <em>Your financial transactions and the football scores and your precise location on earth, pictures of your baby and adoring comments from its grandmother, your job and your friends and your secrets, your final conversation with someone you love, groceries on store shelves, missiles in their silos, the stoplights and the cars waiting at them and the people sitting in the cars and the news on the car radios -- all that and more every day is connected and controlled through an information network that humans created with <strong>code</strong>\r\n</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it appeared, the printing press made written material much more accessible to many more people. Still, not everyone immediately learned to read and write. The people who did learn to read and write are the ones you and I descended from. They fully participated in the new world that the printing press made possible. They controlled economic activity. They made the government and its laws. They recorded the histories. They propagated the world's religions. They owned a portion of the culture, and they fought for their part. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ones who didn't learn to read and write? Most of them lived well enough, just like most people for most of history always have. But a universe of richness and capability eluded them. Fantastic novels, inflammatory pamphlets, laws and holy books: All were just mysterious symbols to the illiterate. Just like code is to so many people now. </p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"imgRgt mll mtl mbl\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4008/4298887640_beb8678204.jpg\" alt=\"Go to it! by drbexl, on Flickr\" height=\"286\" width=\"206\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Today, too many smart people fear or disregard code, and shrug away their disregard as acceptable and normal. But code keeps food on our shelves. Code brings us all we know of world events. Code makes the miracle in your pocket (sorry fellas, I meant the smartphone) possible. Code enables the unfettered personal expression we call a right. Code is the weapon that will win future wars. Code is the medium of future artworks. Code is the conduit of freedom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, since you read this far, you obviously have plenty of time. So c'mon -- why don't you make some code? Here are a few places to start:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://tryruby.org\">Try Ruby</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\">Codecademy</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/tutorials/programming-basics\">Khan Academy</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Every month we take\r\n<a title=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/submissions/new\" href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/submissions/new\">submissions</a> for actualizing ideas and projects that make Boulder and the world around us more awesome. Unlike other grants, submissions are not judged on a stringent set of qualifications- the grants are given on an intuitive, instinctive basis. </p>\r\n<p>The projects that get funded are answers to questions like these: <em>What would make Boulder more awesome for more people? What can be done with $1000 to elicit joy, beauty, ingenuity, community, good health, good humor and good works? What could be a provocative subversion of what we take for granted, or provide a real engagement with our neighbors, or an inventive celebration of spontaneous and artful expression, or a truly generative public service?</em> Awesome Boulder is all about making Boulder more gorgeous, thought-provoking, happy, compelling and fun \"i.e. awesome\" for the greater benefit of our community and is always taking <a title=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/submissions/new\" href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/submissions/new\">submissions</a> for imaginative ways to make that happen. </p>\r\n<p>We're also are putting on a BBQ at dojo4 to bring the community together and spread the word about Awesome Boulder on Friday, 10/12. Join us to find out more about Boulder Awesome and help get out the word to anyone who may have awesome ideas so that we can support them. (We're also are looking for awesome sponsors to support the event...)</p>\r\n<p>The Awesome Boulder grant for August is still available, so please <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/submissions/new\" href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/submissions/new\">apply</a> and let us know what you would do with $1000 to make Boulder more awesome.</p>",

I was working in the IBM offices there when someone, who knew someone who knew someone who needed a French Canadian to man at a help desk referred me. I soon landed at the Denver International Airport in a snow storm and have been here since.\"</p>\n<p><em>What kind of technologist are you?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\"I was 3 credits short of getting a minor in Theology. This has definitively shaped how I think and approach technologies and projects. The irony of studying (and later rejecting) a dogma has helped me avoid a dogmatic approach to programming, architecture and technology in general.\"</p>\n<p><em>What's your favorite thing about what you do for a living?</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>\"We go from a vague, barely defined idea to a product or a service that can have an impact on many people and even change lives. There are very few careers where this can occur without extraordinary effort or capital. There is also the sheer excitement of doing things that many times have not been done before while following well travelled paths.\"</p>\n<p><em>Tell us a little about your family and your life here in Colorado...</em>\n</p>\n<p>\"We live a quiet life here in Colorado. Most of my family time revolves around playing Angry Bird and World of Goo with my 2 year old son and watching his twin sister sing and dance to her own song. It's a nice quiet life!\"</p>\n<p><em>What will your be known for 100 years from now?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\"The downside of working with technology is that it is very transient. I suspect that I will have faded from our collective memory well before a 100 years from now. I might however be remembered by my great-great-grand-kids as this crazy old man that no one could understand due to his heavy accent.\"</p>\n<p><em>If dojo4 was a desert island and you were stuck on it, what would you want to have with you?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\"All the books that I want to read but can't quite seem to get to...\"</p>",

      "author": "garett@dojo4.com",
      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\n\n<p>Working through projects at <a href=\"http://dojo4.com\">Dojo4</a> I’m often surprised to see the way that seemingly tiny increases in technical complexity <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion\">compound</a> into significant attention and resource sinks.  Consequently, when projects are initially getting going, we tend to favor a simplified hosting and application stack which shares many features commonly seen in shared hosting services.  This includes choices like hosting the app and db together, employing a single deployment user on the hosting system, and simple <a href=\"http://uptimerobot.com\">uptime monitoring</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, our long time client, <a href=\"http://www.inspirecommerce.com/\">Inspire Commerce</a>, developed a new business plan requiring that their application meet the stringent <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/\">Payment Card Industry</a> (PCI) Level 1 security compliance for processing, transmitting, and storing credit card information.  Many of the security requirements detailed in the PCI <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/\">Data Security Standard</a> (DSS) motivate a significant change in thinking from the streamlined focused stack mentioned above.   This post will briefly enumerate some of these details and outline our solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The PCI DSS is broken into 12 sections covering everything from firewall configuration to personnel security policies.  I’ll run down a few of the sections which are relevant to the hosting stack.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-install-and-maintain-a-firewall-configuration-to-protect-cardholder-data\">1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data</h2>\n\n<p>This is a pretty detailed section of the DSS which mandates the installation and configuration of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29\">firewall</a> services on all networking devices, from workstations, to routers, to servers.  Using <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (EC2) as the foundation of our hosting stack, many of these networking devices are abstracted out of our view or control.  Conveniently, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/security/#certifications\">AWS is itself PCI Level 1 compliant</a> leaving a lot of these details to the engineers at Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>However, firewalls for the EC2 nodes themselves does require some conideration.   EC2 nodes are protected by a firewall implemented at the <a href=\"www.xen.org/products/xenhyp.html\">hypervizor</a> layer and configured by AWS <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html\">Security Groups</a>.  Our basic Security Group has all ports denying packets with the exception of 22, 80, &amp; 443 accepting from all sources.  We run <a href=\"www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Linux</a> on our nodes and out of the box have the <a href=\"www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/\">IP Tables</a> firewall configured with an open policy.</p>\n\n<p>The PCI DSS focuses on using firewalls to create secure private networks, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29\">De-Militarized-Zones</a> (DMZ) for systems hosting apps which process payment card data.  AWS Security Groups provide a useful mechanism for creating secure private networks between various components of the application stack.  For example, by creating a WEB security group and a DB security group, and opening the database port in the DB security group to only WEB security group sources, the EC2 hypervisor firewall running on a database server will only allow access to the database from web servers connecting on the internal private network interface.</p>\n\n<p>For redundancy, we mirror the AWS Security Group configuration for the EC2 hypervisor firewall with the <a href=\"http://www.cloudpassage.com/\">CloudPassage</a> service which is able to manage the IP Tables firewall at the operating system layer of systems hosting components of the card processing application.  CloudPassage organizes firewall policies in <a href=\"http://www.cloudpassage.com/features/halo-firewall.html\">Server Groups</a> which are somewhat analogous to AWS Security Groups.  Another great feature of CloudPassage is the <a href=\"http://www.cloudpassage.com/features/multifactor-authentication.html\">GhostPorts</a> service.  We configure the ssh port policy in CloudPassage to accept connections from GhostPort sources.  In order for a client machine to become a GhostPort source, a user on that machine must authenticate to the CloudPassage portal, be authorized to open GhostPorts for a server group, and authenticate with a registered Yubikey dongle, or respond to an SMS challenge with a registered cell phone.  Upon successful authentication and authorization, CloudPassage configures IP Tables to accept connections from the client machine source ip.  This is a convenient, secure, temporary, and auditable way to manage access to sensitive hosts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-do-not-use-vendor-supplied-defaults-for-system-passwords-and-other-security-parameters\">2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters</h2>\n\n<p>This section would seem to be pretty obvious.  A good example of the importance of changing vendor supplied default password is the <a href=\"http://www.splunk.com/\">Splunk</a> <a href=\"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Deploy/Introducingtheuniversalforwarder\">Universal Forwarder</a> default password of changeme.</p>\n\n<p>However buried in this section is an important hosting requirement somewhat unrelated to the section title.  “2.2.1 Implement only one primary function per server to prevent functions that require different security levels from co-existing on the same server. (For example web servers, database servers, and DNS should be implemented on separate servers)”.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, AWS security groups make the task of securely separating services like web and database servers onto separate hosts pretty simple.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-use-and-regularly-update-anti-virus-software-or-programs\">5. Use and regularly update anti-virus software or programs</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://clamav.com\">ClamAV</a> makes quick work of this requirement on Ubuntu Linux.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"8-assign-a-unique-id-to-each-person-with-computer-access\">8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access</h2>\n\n<p>The intent of this section is to facilitate auditability and accountability by removing shared user accounts.  Since we use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen\">key based</a> authentication mechanism for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">secure shell</a> access, there are three primary concerns for knowing who did what.  First it is necessary to prevent user from being able to switch to another user account with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_%28Unix%29\">su command</a>.  This is easily accomplished by removing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_permissions#Traditional_Unix_permissions\">execute permission</a> on the su binary and modify <a href=\"http://aplawrence.com/Basics/understandingpam.html\">/etc/pam.d</a> prevent all su authorization.  Second, ensure that the <a href=\"http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/jpmg/ssh/authorized_keys_howto.html\">authorized_keys</a> files for all user accounts only contain a single entry.  Lastly, ensure that all keys used for secure shell access are password protected and that a policy is in place to forbid sharing of keys between users.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the <a href=\"http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-audit-files-to-see-who-made-changes-to-a-file.html\">Linux Audit Daemon</a> (AuditD) can be used to track system activity to specific users.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"9-restrict-physical-access-to-cardholder-data\">9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data</h2>\n\n<p>The title of this section is pretty self explanatory.  Basically, this section covers the topics of restricting physical data center access to authorized personnel.  Similar to the discussion of network device firewall configuration above, this is covered by the AWS PCI Level 1 certification and the details can be left to Amazon.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"10-track-and-monitor-all-access-to-network-resources-and-cardholder-data\">10. track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data</h2>\n\n<p>The motivation of this section is “preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise”.  This involves topics like logging, file integrity management, and intrusion detection.  Our strategy starts with the employment of a logging service to support aggregation of logs, retention of logs, as well as searching of log records.  We are using the <a href=\"http://splunk.com\">Splunk</a> application for this functionality.  We setup an EC2 instance for a logging server and installed Splunk.  We setup AWS Security Groups and CloudPassage ServerGroups for the new server which has the Splunk listener port accepting connections from web server and db server sources on the private network interface.  Next we setup the Splunk Universal Forwarder on web and db servers and configured the forwarders to monitor application, apache, mongodb, sys, audit, &amp; auth logs.</p>\n\n<p>For file integrity monitoring and intrusion detection we installed the <a href=\"http://www.ossec.net/?page_id=165\">OSSEC</a> application on all of our servers and added all of the logs that OSSEC writes to the Splunk forwarders.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

Today was one of those days, and the change came in the form of a new logo on our front door. </p>\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Photo\" title=\"Photo\" src='/ro/dojo4/brand-new/assets/photo.JPG' height=\"450\" width=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>There's been a lot of fresh mountain water under the bridge since the day back in early 2010 when dojo4 co-founder, Jeffrey Larrimore (of tear-away pants and <a title=\"https://twitter.com/okayjeffrey\" href=\"https://twitter.com/okayjeffrey\">@okayjeffrey</a> fame) did his magic, designed the original dojo4 logo and put it on the door of our burgeoning new little business. That logo is the brand that got us known around town and beyond, and has made us recognizable as the one-chop shop that \"will send ninjas.\" It's the elegant and iconographic logo that brought us more than our fair share of fun and success. And it's what people have seen for the past two and a half years every time they walk happily through our door.</p>\n<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Photo 1\" title=\"Photo 1\" src='/ro/dojo4/brand-new/assets/photo-1.JPG' height=\"450\" width=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>The decision to change the logo is a reflection of the ongoing growth and metamorphosis of dojo4 and the people that comprise it. It's a reflection of the agility that is our necessary approach to manifesting a resilient company culture and durable client services. It reflects the playful vision we have for engaging rewardingly with the world around us. </p>\n<p>Indeed, we've found that it's possible to thrive on change, rather than be thrashed by it, and that in order to do so requires being unsentimental and the ability to <a title=\"http://www.talkingsquid.net/archives/32\" href=\"http://www.talkingsquid.net/archives/32\">murder our darlings</a>. It requires that we ride change rather than be ridden by it. It requires always being willing to try something new and always being willing to know ourselves better.</p>\n<p>So we thank you very much, Jeffrey, for coining the seminal dojo4 brand and are looking forward to seeing what this new one brings us- and the one after that, and the one after that... </p>\n<p>Also: look for our new site, to be launched soon.</p>\n<p><img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"Jeff\" title=\"Jeff\" src='/ro/dojo4/brand-new/assets/jeff.jpg' height=\"225\" width=\"225\" /> </p>\n<p><em>[The ever adroit and bewhiskered Jeffrey Larrimore (jeffreylarrimore.com<span>)]</span>\n</em>\n</p>",

      "body": "<p>Upon pondering the redesign of our visual identity here at dojo4, I reflected on the art guilds of renaissance Italy and other artisan workshop models. After all, everything we create here is customized to serve the needs and aspirations of the patron. For instance, Da Vinci's marketing brochure boasted of 36 services his workshop could offer a potential patron. It is from that devotion to breadth and attention to craft that we take our cue.</p>\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/handcrafted-code-and-design/assets/2012-08-31-15.51.42.jpg' title=\"2012 08 31 15.51.42\" alt=\"2012 08 31 15.51.42\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p>During the renaissance era there was an  technological boom that was unprecedented in Western European history. I suspect Boulder is in the midst of such a technological and cultural boom. One area we should continually nourish is a commitment to making Boulder beautiful and elegantly designed. Much of the media focus is turned towards our burgeoning tech community and the athletic community that has grown up around our inherited outdoor playground. In addition to these widely-publicized traits, Boulder must continue on the path of providing a thriving art and design scene. For my part, I sorely wish to take part in the continued nourishing of art and design in Boulder. In this spirit, I have taken the position as Creative Director at dojo4.com. </p>\n<p>I have served in a variety of technological and aesthetic positions at a unusual range of organizations. I have served at <a href=\"http://vermilion.com\" title=\"http://vermilion.com\">Vermilion</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/kqed/oceanadventures/\" title=\"http://www.pbs.org/kqed/oceanadventures/\" target=\"_blank\">Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society</a>, a UN non-proliferation think tank, <a href=\"http://www.tendrilinc.com/\" title=\"http://www.tendrilinc.com/\">Tendril</a>, and have found a new home at dojo4. My background in illustration, music, technology and design will hopefully serve our studio well.</p>\n<p>We continually strive to be a community resource and 'one chop shop' that provides initial consultation all the way through execution. I want the office and brand to have the feel of a trusted community resource. When I was growing up, we commonly visited the local service station, the neighborhood machine shop, the grocer. Doing design and software has the same flavor for me. We are here to serve the Boulder community and to help beautify our civic environment.</p>\n<p>We commissioned our lovely felt project management board from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mlkshkmlkshnk\" title=\"https://twitter.com/mlkshkmlkshnk\">@mlkshkmlkshnk</a> and our new letterpress business cards from <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smokeproof/sets/72157615615208221/\" title=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/smokeproof/sets/72157615615208221/\">Smokeproof Press</a>. We are loving the artisan textures of the collateral and the grounding feeling that handmade objects afford. Worktables created by <a href=\"http://mccordwoodandsteel.com/\" title=\"http://mccordwoodandsteel.com/\">McCord Wood + Steel </a>&#160;are currently gracing our public space. These are being borrowed from the magnificently talented folks over at <a href=\"http://goodappl.es/\" title=\"http://goodappl.es/\">Goodapples</a>.\n</p>\n<p>We run an open office, so please stop in and say hello. We also host design meet-ups frequently, so please feel free to get ahold of me if you would like to join us. Bring ideas that will benefit not only the Boulder tech and design scene, but also the community at large.</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/handcrafted-code-and-design/assets/2012-08-20-14.44.49.jpg' title=\"2012 08 20 14.44.49\" alt=\"2012 08 20 14.44.49\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/handcrafted-code-and-design/assets/2012-08-31-15.49.46.jpg' title=\"2012 08 31 15.49.46\" alt=\"2012 08 31 15.49.46\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"401\" /></p>\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/handcrafted-code-and-design/assets/2012-08-31-15.51.02.jpg' title=\"2012 08 31 15.51.02\" alt=\"2012 08 31 15.51.02\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n",

      "body": "<p><a title=\"http://twitter.com/hellojeffrey\" href=\"http://twitter.com/hellojeffrey\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n  <article class=\"span7\">\r\n<p>I remember that first meeting. It was <a title=\"http://twitter.com/okayjeffrey\" href=\"http://twitter.com/okayjeffrey\">Jeff</a>, <a title=\"http://twitter.com/digidigo\" href=\"http://twitter.com/digidigo\">Dave</a>, <a title=\"http://twitter.com/hoosteeno\" href=\"http://twitter.com/hoosteeno\">me</a> and <a title=\"http://twitter.com/drawohara\" href=\"http://twitter.com/drawohara\">Ara</a>. We were on a rooftop bar in Boulder. It was fall. The leaves were changing and the sun was angling down. We were all ready for something new. Not a job: Something different. We would do it together. First we would name it, and then we would work it. It couldn't fail. We were smart and strong. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ara found the spot, a tiny joint behind Ted's Montana Grill. It was trashed: No flooring, terrible paint, an awful dirty unfriendly bathroom. Naturally we rented it, and I think Jeff started sleeping there immediately. He was up all night painting for a week straight. All four of us helped when we could, but Jeff was there every single day. And within a few weeks the humble space had become dojo4. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>dojo4 was the first name that nobody protested. It was short and easy to remember; it held a secret mystery, something admirable and maybe dangerous. Or vice versa. dojo4 beat out \"Death Ninja Squad\", which I protested because I didn't want to try and market death to my straightlaced customers. dojo4 also beat out \"The Mulberry Club\" -- I have no idea why I thought that one was good. </p>\r\n<p>dojo4 was going to be a coworking space. Invite only, like a speakeasy with Macbooks. We would charge people to join the club. They'd get a door code. Once we decided this, I got busy writing regulations and policies while Ara and Jeff argued about decor and Dave hacked on mobile apps. Amazingly, in that first month we convinced some folks to sign up to be members!</p>\r\n<p>Well, it didn't take long before we realized that our 3-square-foot bathroom/kitchen combo would never adequately serve a crowded coworking space. And furthermore, we couldn't see how coworking would ever pay for itself. And meanwhile, people kept walking in the door asking us to build things for them. Web sites. Custom applications. Stuff like that. So we quickly pivoted and became dojo4, the \"one chop shop\".</p>\r\n<p>From that moment things moved very quickly. We hired people; we brought on another partner, <a title=\"http://twitter.com/coreykohn\" href=\"http://twitter.com/coreykohn\">Corey</a>; we lost Jeff to San Francisco and Dave to <a title=\"http://splickit.com\" href=\"http://splickit.com\">Splick*It</a>; we hired more people. All the while we turned out bespoke web applications and sites for enthusiastic entrepreneurs. We generated enough caffeine demand to light up two new coffeeshops on the east side. The nature of our work, our brand and our team were subject to constant change. It was wildly dynamic. </p>\r\n<p>It's been said many times, so I will merely echo it: The Boulder community made our business possible. People came by at all hours, from the first day until the present day, just wanting to spread cheer and offer a hand. They brought beer; samurai swords; fertility idols; jobs; friends; advice; opportunities. Boulder is awesome. All together we are the caretakers of something special.</p>\r\n<p>One of dojo4's earlier web sites was built around a single enigmatic declaration: \"What we do and how we do it is who we are.\" That's terrible marketing, but it's true. dojo4 has always been primarily a collection of smart people willing to devote their attention and energy to interesting projects, no matter the nature of the work. At one point I fielded an inquiry from someone who wanted a chicken coop built. I tried to get the work, but we were outbid. Their loss.</p>\r\n<p>I love that about dojo4. I'm a generalist, equally as comfortable in a late night vi-git-cap loop as I am teaching of a crowd of nontechnical people about search engines; just as happy writing marketing copy (most recently on <a title=\"http://www.collectiveintellect.com/\" href=\"http://www.collectiveintellect.com/\">Collective Intellect's new site</a>) as I am writing Javascript (recently for ultrarunner <a title=\"http://scottjurek.com/\" href=\"http://scottjurek.com/\">Scott Jurek</a>'s <a title=\"https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_tumblr\" href=\"https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_tumblr\">blog</a> and <a title=\"https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_plancast\" href=\"https://github.com/Hoosteeno/inject_plancast\">calendar</a>). Working for dojo4 meant I could do any of it, any day of the week.</p>\r\n<p>Being a generalist often means doing whatever needs doing. And at a small business, that often means being the CEO. So since 2011 I've been dojo4's first CEO, working with Corey and Ara to build a vibrant little business that we're all very proud of. I've never had a more challenging or rewarding work life. In this role I've met entrepreneurs from all around the world; I've built and launched things way out on the cutting edge of technology; and I've worked with a remarkable team of people, too many great folks to name here. It's been wonderful.</p>\r\n<p>But <strong>today I'm leaving dojo4</strong>. This is the time of year for change: The sky is changing, the leaves are changing, dojo4 is changing, and I'm changing too. My lovely wife has a wiggly baby on the way. Right away I'm going to spend some time learning what it means to be a dad. And after that I'll also be looking for some new interesting work to do, something that needs a generalist like me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the good people I've met down at the dojo: Let's meet again. Seriously. Email <a title=\"justin@dojo4.com\" href=\"mailto:justin@dojo4.com?subject=Let's meet!\">justin@dojo4.com</a> right now; let's go get a coffee or a beer (I'll buy) and let's talk about what's next. Thank you all.</p>\r\n</article>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"span5\">\r\n<img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"Img 2642\" title=\"Img 2642\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2642.JPG' />\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Img 2831\" title=\"Img 2831\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2831.JPG' />\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Img 2750\" title=\"Img 2750\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2750.JPG' />\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Img 2700\" title=\"Img 2700\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2700.JPG' />\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Img 2701\" title=\"Img 2701\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2701.JPG' />\r\n\r\n<img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"Img 20101217 200955\" title=\"Img 20101217 200955\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-20101217-200955.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Img 20110202 154457\" title=\"Img 20110202 154457\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-20110202-154457.jpg' />\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Img 2828\" title=\"Img 2828\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2828.JPG' />\r\n\r\n<img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"2010 02 23 16.07.43\" title=\"2010 02 23 16.07.43\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/2010-02-23-16.07.43.jpg' height=\"249\" width=\"249\" />\r\n\r\n<img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"Img 2832\" title=\"Img 2832\" src='/ro/dojo4/hello-goodbye-dojo4/assets/img-2832.JPG' height=\"249\" width=\"249\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n",

      "body": "<p><img rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Id Rather Be At Work Smoothfluid\" title=\"Id Rather Be At Work Smoothfluid\" src='/ro/dojo4/bring-the-noise-or-not/assets/id-rather-be-at-work-smoothfluid.jpg' height=\"450\" width=\"300\" /></p>\r\n<p>I'm rarely in the same place two days in row. I get to work, slide my MacBook Air out of my bike basket and plunk myself down where every suits my fancy for the day (or at least in whatever there's a seat left). I've gone through phases where I will hunker down at the same desk for a few weeks, but since we have an open office with no assigned desks, none of us tend to attach to one spot for too long. With brief experimental exceptions, dojo4 has been like that since we opened almost three years ago. There are desks and standing desks, there are tables and couches, and anyone one who works here (and often many who don't!) are sitting in various arrangements and combinations at these various \"stations\" throughout the day and week. We each have our own laptops, and that's about it. The closest that we've gotten to personalized spaces are the individual laundry baskets in the closet that we each have to keep our stuff, and these get used to greater and lesser extents, depending on the person. </p>\r\n<p>This means a few things:</p>\r\n<ul><li>I don't get to have a cozy, personalized desk with its predictable familiarity</li>\r\n<li>I don't have to have a cozy, personalized desk with its predictable familiarity</li>\r\n<li>I can move according to whom I may be working with that day, my mood, the light and the noise/distraction level</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And that's exactly where the main drawback comes in: noise/distraction level. A more \"traditional\" office setting may be more spatially dictatorial and environmentally regimented, but it also often allows for more focussed spaces and distraction-limited areas. Here at dojo4, there are very few doors that can be closed. In order to make a phone call, so as not to disturb my colleagues, most often I have to go outside and take a walk around the block while I talk (which does, however, have its own anti-sedative advantages). This is a hubbubby place. It's less than 1000 sq. feet and there are seven people that work here regularly. As I write this, Steve, Fred and Garett sit just a few feet away talking about frameworks for a particular job and then the etymology of various French words. Peter pipes in with some potential Sanskrit swear words. Two guys who don't even work here sit right next to me talking about how to keep track of the head of a Github repository. There's something that sounds like Turkish dance music playing through the speaker near me. Diversions, diversions. </p>\r\n<p>It turns out that \"<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us.html#100000\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us.html#100000\">we have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input</a>,\" and so working in an \"open-plan office\" can greatly reduce productivity. <a title=\"http://www.juliantreasure.com/\" href=\"http://www.juliantreasure.com/\">Julian Treasure</a>, a sound expert, recommends <a title=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us.html#100000\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us.html#100000\">for the sake of our health and our productivity that we can take control of the sound around us</a>. It's a rare talent to be able to focus one-pointedly, tuning out all other diversions, although it is possible to <a title=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/05/11/0956797610371339.abstract\" href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/05/11/0956797610371339.abstract\">hone this useful ability through meditation</a> and other techniques. Most of us put on our headphones as a way into a virtual cubicle. In open offices \"<a title=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/science/when-buzz-at-your-cubicle-is-too-loud-for-work.html\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/science/when-buzz-at-your-cubicle-is-too-loud-for-work.html\">headphones are the new wall</a>.\" So many of us sit here together in our own auditory worlds, attempting to get a day's work done. </p>\r\n<p>That being said, I do not want to have my own assigned desk, and most of the people I work with have also rejected that possibility. Our space is a pleasant place to spend the day. It is comfortable, conducive to collaboration and often ringing with good humor and general friendliness.We do get a lot done, make clients happy, work well with each other and have a lot of fun.</p>\r\n<p>So how do we balance our affinity for flexibility, openness, fluidity and the creativity produced by chaos, with our desire to be able to focus, to be left alone to do our jobs and for the creativity that is produced by order? We've come up with a few ideas:</p>\r\n<ul><li>make part of everyday (like mornings) a quiet period - a mutually agreed upon daily period of \"functional talking only\"</li>\r\n<li>carve out spaces that are quiet zones, where a door can be closed and it is acknowledged that whoever is working in there needs quiet</li>\r\n<li>get another, off-site place that is dedicated as a quiet work/creative space </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We have not yet found a solution that suits us. It's a work in progress and we'll continue to try to find the balance between chaos and order- a balance that keeps us miles away from cubicle-ization but safely within the supports of a conducive and undistracting environment.

It's open to anyone, long-time meditators and newbies alike. Simple instruction in mindfulness-based meditation, that focuses on the breath, is available upon request. We host it because we've found meditation to be super useful for ourselves and figure others in the neighborhood might like a place to meditate once a week, as well.

Don’t believe it?  Check this out:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/4039805.js?file=polluted.rb.txt\"></script>\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>the results were produced using this script</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/4039805.js?file=polluted.rb\"></script>\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>some people have claimed that this will always be a side effect of having nice DSLs, but this is simply not true:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/4040698.js?file=dsl.rb\"></script>\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>so, learn how to write DSLs the right way people.  the right way is any way that doesn’t dump methods all over ever object and namespace without an <em>extremely</em> good reason.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n“it should read nice” is <em>not</em> a good reason.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
