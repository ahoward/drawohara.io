<div><p>We just launched a marketing website for <a title="http://plantednutrition.com" href="http://plantednutrition.com">Planted Nutrition</a>, a new nutrition practice in Boulder run by Ellen Teig.&#160;</p>
<p>Planted Nutrition is a fresh business, just starting to cook, and Ellen wanted a bright, professional web site to help clients learn more about her services and approach. Ellen's budget and needs were both small, so we decided to build a quick one-page site showcasing all her content.</p>
<p>Ellen's design inspirations included several culinary blogs with big, beautiful pictures of food. Anthony Dimitre brought that bold look into the page with a couple very nice carrots. </p>
<p>Anthony also put together a nice logo that will flavor all of Planted Nutrition's other materials -- business cards, client packets, and more.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Planted Nutrition is a static web site built with <a title="http://middlemanapp.com/" href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. We can't say enough about this tool. Static site generation isn't new, and Middleman isn't the first static site generator, but it is a <em>very good</em> tool. </p>
<p>At dojo4 we're using Middleman as an alternative to the ubiquitous LAMP content management systems. There are several good LAMP CMS tools out there, but they aren't one-size-fits-all, and they all require some trade-offs. In this case, even a CMS as simple as Wordpress would be too complex and maintenance-heavy for Planted Nutrition's immediate needs.</p>
<p>Someday, Planted Nutrition may want something more than a static site. But meanwhile, this tasty site is plenty. </p>
