<p>The Awesome Foundation is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/about_us">an ever-growing, worldwide network of people</a> devoted to forwarding the interest of awesomeness in the universe. Created in the long hot summer days of 2009 in Boston, the Foundation distributes a series of monthly $1,000 grants to projects and their creators. The money is pooled together from the coffers of ten or so self-organizing "micro-trustees" and given upfront in cash, check, or gold doubloons. The chapters are autonomous and organized by the trustees around geographic areas or topics of interest. The Foundation provides these grants with no strings attached and claims no ownership over the projects it supports. It is, in the words of one of our trustees, a micro-genius grant for flashes of micro-brilliance

  Awesome Boulder was started by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ironicallySo">Brandon Line</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/about_us">bio</a>), who invited us at dojo4 to be part of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awesomeboulder.org/">the awesome group of mostly average people who live and/or work in Boulder</a> and are micro-trustees for the monthly awesome grant.
