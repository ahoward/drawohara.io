They're midway through their inaugural season and are kicking butt. In case you're unfamiliar, Cross Cultured runs a membership program for young, culturally curious individuals that gives access to a special event series at some of the various arts institutions around Denver. This summer, the program will run until October 31st. It's not too late to check out their [list of remaining events](https://crosscultured.org/events) and [become a member](https://crosscultured.org/signup)!

dojo4 and [Moshi Moshi Co.](http://gomoshimoshi.com/) had a chance to help out Cross Cultured throughout the springtime by collaborating on their web presence and membership backend. Here are few highlights:

* Mobile Friendly: utilizing [industry-recognized tools](http://getbootstrap.com/), we quickly built a site that feels good on all devices
* [Stripe Checkout Integration](https://stripe.com/checkout): they can easily track revenue, manage discounts, and issue refunds
* Content/Data Management: Cross Cultured staff can login and manage all the necessary content and data to drive their homepage, events, and member program
* Reporting: Their back-office work is streamlined through detailed and exportable reporting

This was really enjoyable for us because we got to leverage our expertise and past experience to build up a deserving organization and cause. Let us know what you think by commenting using the "Tweet" button below!
