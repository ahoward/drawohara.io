As a follow up to my [Step 0](http://dojo4.com/blog/step-0-getting-started-building-a-purposeful-organization) post the other day, I wanted to offer some insight into the current status of [Moshi Moshi Co.](http://gomoshimoshi.com/) along these lines.

__WRITE IT DOWN__ This process began essentially on day 1 of MMCO at our kickoff retreat and we ended up with some high-level aspirations in our internal wiki. After that though, the next writing we did was the most recent blog post. Our current WIP is creating a more fully-formed "About Us" page on the [website](http://gomoshimoshi.com/) as there isn't much there currently.

__REVISIT OFTEN__ We currently have a short, weekly status meeting on Fridays at 1pm. If you'd like to sit in on one, [let me know](mailto:ryan@gomoshimoshi.com)! Part of these meetings will soon be checking in around our more purposeful, non-$$ focused progress/tasks.

__HAVE ALLIES//ENABLE OTHERS__ We have begun a search for an arts organization that we could help out and collaborate with as a pair to [Wallspace Finder](http://wallspacefinder.com/). Know anyone who might be interested?

If you have questions, feedback, criticisms, or encouragement to offer on any of these fronts, we'd love to hear from you.
