'Pivoting' is rarely a good thing in software, regardless of how people try
to spin it to their investors.  It is generally made up of one part 'we
fucked up' and one part 'try something fast before we drop it!'

Fortunately we're our own investors at DOJO4 so we don't need to spin
anything.  We just needed to *pivot*.

I don't like telling stories in order, and you've got things to do, so let me
cut right to the chase:

- DOJO4 is pivoting away from being nothing but a software agency.
- DOJO4 is focusing all it's energy on delivering technology to purpose-driven
  companies.
- DOJO4 has made partnerships that enable it to bring development horsepower,
  & financial horsepower, to bear on said selected purpose-driven companies.

To our current customers, whom we value so much, please know that, we are
continuing to support our current, excellent, crop of DOJO4 customers
indefinitely; we take our all of our commitments seriously, especially those we've
made to you, who've supported us these [past 5 years](/blog/ity). If you'd like to get involved or discuss this with us, please [just let us know](/contact) and we can discuss it further.
