Meetings do not need to happen inside around a table. And meetings do not need to take a long time. 

Instead of shutting yourself in a stuffy room with coworkers or clients, take the conversation outside. Go for a walk- the best meetings happen when there is a change of scenery, fresh air and bodies are moving. Sometimes it actually helps communication not to be face-to-face, but walking side by side, going somewhere. Especially difficult conversations can be easier to have when in motion.

Studies show that being in motion lengthens [our attention spans](http://www.prdaily.com/Main/Articles/What_is_the_length_of_an_audiences_attention_span_12517.aspx), but even if people are interested in the meeting and even if they actually care, attention spans still hover around 7-10 minutes for most meetings. So we've found that it helps maintain morale and a general sense of good humor to keep meetings short, to-the-point and to move them outside whenever possible.
