There’s a good chance that you’ll see a dojo4 family member's face in at least one of the slides!


Also, another presenter that night, [Becky Boone](https://twitter.com/boonrs), is now facing calls for her dismissal from working with the [City of Boulder](https://twitter.com/bouldercolorado) based on the fact that she said ‘fuck’ a handful of times in her talk. 

She is working with the [City of Boulder through a partnership with Code for America](https://bouldercolorado.gov/planning/code-for-america), and was calling for more civic engagement from Boulder’s under-represented citizens. 

Watch her talk: [Why you should care about your local government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mme2iqk1IYU).
