On Monday, March 12th, dojo4 is co-hosting a group of young social innovators, 17-19 years old, from six different countries - Afghanistan, Zambia, Nigeria, Malaysia, Swaziland, and Uganda. They are students in the Social Entrepreneurship Incubator program at the United World College in Montezuma, NM - an international high school, one of the thirteen of its kind around the world.

The students are:

* Gilbert - We Enrich Business - fair micro-finance for blue collar workers in Zambia
* Mzwakithi - Platforms for Hope - enabling young kids in Swaziland to learn with lap desks
* Gideon - starting a recycling business on campus in preparation for a larger Recycle Nigeria project
* Farid & Fiachra - The Library Project - filling an empty library in Palestine
* Andrew - Transformative Education - transformational learning experiences for high school students in Uganda

From 5-7pm the students will be at [dojo4](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2030+17th+Street+Boulder,+CO+80302&ll=40.019941,-105.273399&spn=0.00981,0.020063&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&hnear=2030+17th+St,+Boulder,+Colorado+80302&gl=us&t=m&z=16&iwloc=r0) to meet, practice their pitches, get feedback and make real world connections.  Along with [w1sd0m](http://w1sd0m.net/), the [Hub](http://w1sd0m.net/), and the [Unreasonable Institute](http://unreasonableinstitute.org/), we're psyched to be supporting these young innovators, entrepreneurs and changemakers.
