<pre>you linked against the wrong openssl lib


you need to run something like this:

(for rvm)

 otool -L ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/x86_64-darwin11.2.0/openssl.bundle


(for rbenv)

 otool -L ~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/x86_64-darwin11.2.0/openssl.bundle


if you have any references to /opt or any non-osx openssl lib (say
from brew) you are F***** and will need to rebuild ruby.  this is the
source of the ssh/http/and random seg faults you've been having on
various projects.
