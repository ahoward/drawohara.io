<p>I recently found myself devising styles for the "short story" posts on my personal site, which I decided to re-plumb, switching from WordPress to Octopress and GitHubâ€”post about that experience forthcoming!</p>
<p>In any event, short stories tend to be long-winded (as blog posts go), so I wanted to provide authors with an easy way to include emphatic, semantic section breaks. The humble horizontal rule <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> seemed like the right solution, the more so since <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" class="darkTxt" target="_blank">Markdown</a> makes them so easy to include&mdash;just add <code>***</code> on a new line.</p>
<p>Most browsers render the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag as an inset border&mdash;essentially a dark line stacked directly on top of a lighter line. But that's about as exciting as one of <a href="/#Ara" class="darkTxt" target="_blank">Ara's</a> two hour lectures on the history and advantages of wind-briefs in rural Alaska.</p>
<p>So, I sleuthed the interwebs for sexier solutions and came across an all-too-familiar site: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/simple-styles-for-horizontal-rules/" class="darkTxt" target="_blank">Chris Coyier's CSS Tricks</a>.</p>
<p>A word of caution: because these styles rely on the <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code> pseudo-element selectors, IE7 and below don't do a great job rendering them. Thus, you might have to spend some time futzing with IE-specific styles. Or you might choose to do something more valuable with your time.</p>
