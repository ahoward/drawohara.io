A few years back dojo4 had the privilege of working closely with a unique Boulder startup, [Snugg Home](http://vimeo.com/99368102). Snugg is at the cutting edge of tangible climate change solutions that us regular folk can actually put into practice. 

Tomorrow night Snugg'll be @ the one and only [Impact Hub Boulder](http://www.impacthubboulder.com/) pitching a new product that's made it to the finals of [The City of Boulder's Energy Challenge](https://bouldercolorado.gov/lead/boulder-energy-challenge), a grant program designed to solicit innovative solutions from our community for reducing GHG emissions in Boulder.

dojo4 will be there representing, and we hope you'll join us! The grant panel's judges will be in attendance and will be looking to see which of the six finalists best capture our community's collective imagination - so come make some noise for our buddies @Snugg!
