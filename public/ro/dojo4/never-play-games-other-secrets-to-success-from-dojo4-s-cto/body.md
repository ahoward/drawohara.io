Have you ever wondered how Ara got started as a web developer?  (He used to work on weather data and supercomputers for NOAA, you know).  As one of his non-geek colleagues, [this ugurus interview](http://www.ugurus.com/blog/estimate-the-quality-of-a-developer-by-the-size-of-their-bin-directory-interview-with-ara-howard-of-dojo4) provided some interesting backstory for me, and a good window into the evolution of the modern programmers walking among us.

Around 15:40 he goes into "the" two types of developers (and which type he is) as well as daily best practices for productivity and sanity (20:00) - useful if you're someone who stares at a screen most of the day.

If you really want to know what our inimitable CTO is all about, you'll probably have to offer him a beer.  Or, follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drawohara).
