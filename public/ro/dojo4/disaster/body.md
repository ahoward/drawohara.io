I lunched a machine today.   


Worked until nearly 2am, machine humming warmly, and got up to a slow  unresponsive box.

Disk shattered into bits.

http://dojo4.com is under the gun on *many* projects this month so, of course, it makes sense that some machines would decide to quit the ghost *today*.... #feck.

Every time I recover a blown machine it gets easier, and today was no exception:

Since the last boxen meltdown I've worked hard to get most of my data into the cloud.

So I was happy to have very little to fret about after realizing the Apple Store was going to take a full **72 hours to order a disk** for my end-of-life 17".  Rather, I just dropped 4k on a blazing fast new 15" MBP and launched into recovery...

Here is a brief outline of my current backup strategy, mixed with some thoughts about how managing data is changing fast:


* apps are managing your data more than ever.  use this to your advantage.

* full-on backups are stupid.  you need to be selective to restore fast.  this takes brain power.  what is faster to restore after a crash vs re-install?  what's simpler to re-install vs. re-configure?  hint: data not code and configuration.

* operating systems move faster than your backup software: you should only be backing up data and not configuration or, worse, binary information.  dot files are an exception of course!

* google is king for email, contacts, and cal.  drop any other solutions.

* use git for you codez.  don't back it up.  move on.

* use things.app or something cloud based for your productivy.  non-syncing todo lists are dead.

* owning music is an old fashioned idea.  use rdio, sspotify, or as a last resort iCloud.  but definitely make sure that you have no reason to backup your music.

* pictures are a bitch.   this is an RFP for suggestions.

* movies.  movies shouldn't be on a devleopers box.  there, i said it.

* dropbox.  use this for everything else and eschew your operating system's silly built-in mechanisms.


Summary:

1) use clould based applications

2) owning music and movies is a silly concept.  leave it.

3) put everything else into dropbox
