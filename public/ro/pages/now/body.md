- working with [n5](https://www.nickel5.com/) in boulder on some wild frontier research: training the mind via visual cortex + EEG analysis (literal consciousness hacking), building a 'perfect oracle' DeFi market that models intersubjective reality through collective judgment. it's where neuroscience meets cryptoeconomics meets philosophy. frieNDA and a 🍺 for more deets...

- shipping OSS: [brane](https://github.com/ahoward/brane) (local-first semantic knowledge graph that finds structural problems in code and prose - encode ethics, architecture constraints, and policies as machine-verifiable Datalog rules. split-brain SQLite + CozoDB design. just shipped the unified `brane ingest` pipeline), [bunny](https://github.com/ahoward/bunny) (opinionated Bun + TypeScript app framework built for human-AI development - POD-only data, antagonistic testing workflow, handler registry pattern, zero-class architecture), [gh-lockbox](https://github.com/ahoward/gh-lockbox) (stateless secret recovery via GitHub Actions - rolled at n5), [gh-blob](https://github.com/ahoward/gh-blob) (unlimited blob storage in GitHub), [pbj](https://github.com/ahoward/pbj) (universal encrypted clipboard), [bx](https://github.com/ahoward/bx) (tmux session manager), [tc](https://github.com/ahoward/tc) (language-agnostic testing). 182 public repos and counting. https://github.com/ahoward

- building semantic nervous systems for codebases. ethics without enforcement
  is theater so we encode values as Datalog and verify them. building encrypted
  clipboards that transcend devices. teaching machines when to say no. treating
  tests as scripture and code as sand. claude designs, gemini attacks, humans
  checkpoint. specifications as prophecy. GitHub as cathedral. message buses
  for stateless ghosts. keys hiding in vaults. everything else burns.

- leg's a POS but kinda back in the [mountains](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZLLWKpux5jns3JUH9) after 3 years, a f!ck ton of crutch work, many surgeries, many pain, much sauna, lotta PT...  it continues to be slow and painful.

- quietly building [mountainhigh.codes](https://mountainhigh.codes) - still stealth mode, still not taking clients, still building from weird places.  like cabeese (plural of [caboose](https://photos.app.goo.gl/nzQ2b7Hafbeg1jkt7) and [busen](https://photos.app.goo.gl/RpsGBB1w8JYDY1gc9)
