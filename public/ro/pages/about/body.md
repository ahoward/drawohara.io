well, i get that question often from mean people that can't spell (this from me, a dislexic) but i will answer anyhow...   i've been working on a secret ai based project for close to a year, with some good friends from boulder.  we bring the social context - the voice of the people - to ai.

![english mother fucker do you speak it!?](./assets/speak-english-pulp-fiction.gif)

here's a teeny example of what we're doing.  more soon!

<a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/41b06d15d7afeed9fd82726057ad2646">an ai analysis of public sentiment towards the fortune 500 in america</a>

> please explain.

^that result, was informed by an analysis of over *one million* relevant and highly regraded social media converstaions.  those conversations were analyzed for thematic trends around feelings towards the fortune 500, in general.  you will note that, unlike openai, google's gemini, anthropic, or *ai flavour of the day*, these results are informed by _real_ conversations and, those conversations are included as citations.

at present, i am working to develop and individual threat index for each individual company, also informed by millions of relevant and specific conversations.  reach out iff this is intriguing.

a side note to consider and understand, and i will be writing much, much more about this in the coming weeks, but this analysis is _not_ informed by big tech, seo ladden websites that provide the fodder that foundational models plan to use in order to turn you, my dear reader, into a 🐑, that does not know reality from double-speak, leading you to the 🐺's.  the goal of this work is to bring _what people think_, vs. _what seo experts publish_ , to bear on the questions we ask these fancy new robots.

in the coming week i'll have a public demo and api available (developers, please reach out).

> what is wrong with you!?

_sigh..._
