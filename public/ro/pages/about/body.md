> wut even is that ^ ? and, "why are you so weird"

well, i get that question often from mean people that can't spell (this from me, a dislexic) but i will answer anyhow...   i've been working on a secret ai based project for close to a year, with some good friends from boulder.  we bring the social context - the voice of the people - to ai.

> i am still dumb, and in imminent danger of giving democracy away on facebook, along with my entire existance and that of the human race...,what _is_ that?

it is a threat index, informed by over a million social media converstaions, regarding the fortune 500 in america, built by contextualizing those voices in a custom llm (that's ai speak for 'better than openai because it utilizes people's real voices instead of models trained on piles of seo ladden advertisements designed to make you a 🐑)

> what is wrong with you!?

_sigh..._
