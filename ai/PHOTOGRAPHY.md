## Your Philosophy

### Natural Over Processed

**From your own words:**
> "I've watched landscape photography go off the deep end with excessive editing... I try to do my part by keeping my photography as natural and true-to-life as possible"

You're reacting against the Instagram aesthetic of over-processed landscapes. No:
- Excessive HDR
- Oversaturated colors
- Artificial drama
- Heavy manipulation

### Subject Matter

**Primary subjects (in order of passion):**

1. **Natural landscapes** - Mountains, deserts, wilderness
   - Alaska (where you're from)
   - Colorado mountains
   - Desert landscapes (your 2024 walkabout)
   - Ice caves and remote environments

2. **Dogs** - "traversing natural landscapes and petting dogs"
   - Probably candid, natural shots
   - Not posed studio work

3. **Adventure documentation**
   - Bike touring ("riding my bike to Alaska")
   - Skiing
   - Mountain activities
   - Lightning storms
   - Extreme environments

4. **People in context**
   - Not portrait photography per se
   - People as part of stories
   - Documentary style
   - Real moments, not posed

## What You Do

### Documentary Approach

Based on your Google Photos links and descriptions:
- **Telling stories** - Each album has a narrative
- **Real experiences** - Not staged or artificial
- **Context matters** - Photos serve the story
- **Natural moments** - Candid over posed

### Technical Approach

**Likely characteristics:**

1. **Natural light**
   - You mention lightning storms, landscapes, outdoor activities
   - Not studio work
   - Working with available light

2. **Environmental context**
   - Wide angles showing place
   - Not just isolated subjects
   - Setting tells the story

3. **Action and movement**
   - Skiing, biking, hiking
   - Not static
   - Life in motion

4. **Authentic moments**
   - Real emotions
   - Unposed interactions
   - Documentary truth

## Composition Principles

### Based on Your Writing Style

Since your code and writing emphasize:
- **Simplicity** over cleverness
- **Directness** over abstraction
- **Truth** over embellishment
- **Function** over form

Your photography likely:
- **Simple compositions** - Clear subject, uncluttered
- **Direct framing** - What you see is what you get
- **Honest representation** - No tricks or gimmicks
- **Purposeful** - Every shot serves the story

### Likely Patterns

**Rule of thirds? Maybe.**
- But not religiously
- Composition serves content
- Not following rules blindly

**Leading lines?**
- Natural ones (trails, roads, rivers)
- Not forced
- If they're there, use them

**Golden hour?**
- Sure, when you're out there
- But not planning around it
- Work with what you have

---

## Technical Details

### Gear Philosophy

Based on your "simple beats clever" approach:

**Probably:**
- Good enough camera that works
- Gear that survives adventure

- Function over specs

**Not:**

- Gear-focused

### Processing

**Your stated approach:**
> "keeping my photography as natural and true-to-life as possible"

**Likely workflow:**
1. Minimal processing

4. Crop if needed
5. Done

**Not:**
- Hour-long Photoshop sessions
- Heavy manipulation
- "Instagram look"
- Artificial enhancement

## Story Over Specs

### Your Approach

## Notes

This guide is based on:
- Your stated philosophy about "natural and true-to-life" photography
- Your reaction against over-processed landscape photography
- Your Google Photos album themes (mountains, desert, adventures)
- Your general philosophy from code and writing (simple, direct, honest)
- Your life patterns (Alaska, Colorado, outdoor sports, adventure)

Since I couldn't directly access your photos, this captures your **approach** and **philosophy** rather than specific technical patterns. But knowing you, that's probably what matters anyway.

The photos serve the story. The story is real. Simple as that.
