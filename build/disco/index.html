  <p>as i‚Äôve hinted on some of my socials, i‚Äôve been working at <a href="https://syntheticecho.com/">synthetic echo</a> on a system i‚Äôve named <strong><code>disco</code></strong>.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> stands for <strong>‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù</strong>, and it brings a unique, important, and beneficial aspect to <strong>many</strong> AI applications:</p>

<h3 id="the-social-voice"><strong>‚Äúthe social voice‚Äù</strong></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>what do you mean by that?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>take a look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/ae562567579a3e936d9b9bb7e4ffde88">this example =&gt;</a></p>

<p>as you can probably see, <code>disco</code> is a unique system that utilizes AI and a <strong>curated, distilled, and augmented dataset</strong> of over a million high-quality, organic social conversations from across the internet to <em>bring the social voice to AI</em>.</p>

<p>from the authentic conversations, <code>disco</code> extracts people‚Äôs <strong>hopes</strong>, <strong>fears</strong>, <strong>dreams</strong>, and more.  then the conversations are organized into <strong>audiences</strong>, to which you can literally ask <em>any question</em>.</p>

<p>but here‚Äôs the kicker: unlike google‚Äôs gemini, which informs you in ways optimized to sell ads, or openAI, which informs you‚Ä¶ for reasons we can only guess.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> informs you with <strong>real conversations from real people.</strong></p>

<p>and it gives <strong>citations to those conversations</strong>, so that you can guage the reality of the answers it gives <em>for yourself</em>.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> does not give you some sanitized, middle-of-the-bell-curve, socially correct, book report style answer to your questions.  it gives you back answers that <strong>real people</strong> could, and would give.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what would you do if you could ask your audience <em>anything</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the <strong>audiences</strong> in this particular example were built from subreddits. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/95092a816c9a3f752f9d8ec421f24be5">you can see the configurations i used here.</a> other sources are possible, of course, including thousands of message boards, threads, and, comign soon, bluesky.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>i‚Äôm lost‚Ä¶</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>let‚Äôs clarify. <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/ae562567579a3e936d9b9bb7e4ffde88">in the example ==¬ª</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we gave <code>disco</code> the prompt: <em>‚Äúwhat keeps you up at night?‚Äù</em>.</li>
  <li>it ran this prompt by <strong>42 distinct audiences</strong>.</li>
  <li>for each audience, it provided a sample of citations, alongside it‚Äôs answer, so you can verify the sources yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>this entire process took about five minutes to run.</p>

<p>so, this is how using <code>disco</code>, you can leverage AI to inform any task that could benefit from contextualizing the subject of inquiry in <strong>the authentic social voice</strong>.</p>

<p>applications include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running dynamic real-time surveys on audiences before making decisions.</li>
  <li>having specific audiences review proposals or content and give honest feedback, in their own words.</li>
  <li>mocking elections.</li>
  <li>understanding unfiltered thoughts about your company, practice, or brand.</li>
  <li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-disco"><strong>why <code>disco</code>?</strong></h3>

<p>this project started with a focus on sales and marketing but has evolved towards much broader applicability: politics, social issues, product development‚Ä¶ you name it.</p>

<p>anytime you think, <em>‚Äúwhat would people think about this?‚Äù</em> you can stop wondering: with <code>disco</code>, you can find out <strong>now</strong>.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> isn‚Äôt about getting ‚Äúthe right‚Äù answer; it‚Äôs about getting <strong>the answer real humans would actually give</strong>.</p>

<p>every entrepreneur understands the difference between these two styles of answers and, the good ones want the unbiased truth.</p>

<p>with some marketing tools, you could discover, that people really want ‚Äòdark mode‚Äô or ‚Äòa bookmark feature‚Äô in the app you‚Äôre building.  with <code>disco</code>, you might discover that no one even wants another app - the one question your research company forgot to ask.</p>

<h3 id="how-disco-works"><strong>how <code>disco</code> works</strong></h3>

<p>from an ip perspective, <code>disco</code> has several unique strengths:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>it doesn‚Äôt just show you what‚Äôs commonly accepted or said. instead, it identifies <strong>clusters of outliers</strong>: the conversations most relevant to consider. while other AI approaches aim for safe, generic answers, <code>disco</code> delivers <strong>real answers backed by evidence.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it uses an innovative pre-indexing system, making information retrieval fast and scalable.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>wut?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>it‚Äôs fine if this sounds technical! if you‚Äôre not a developer or vc, you can stop reading here.</p>

<p>but if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we‚Äôre releasing an API with a single, simple endpoint. you‚Äôll be able to add ‚Äúthe social voice‚Äù to your rag pipelines with about 3‚Äì5 lines of code, no matter what AI you use. <a href="/contact">contact me</a> for a beta API key‚Äîpriority goes to devs willing to share their use cases.</li>
  <li>a demo app will be out in 7‚Äì10 days.</li>
  <li>we‚Äôre working to integrate the bluesky firehose, with the goal of becoming the authority on ‚Äúthe real voice‚Äù for RLHF training data wars. cryptographic guarantees of authorship included ;-).</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/contact">reach out</a> if this sounds like your kind of thing.</p>

<p>and for the curious, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/95093a816c9a3f752f9d8ec421f24be5">here‚Äôs the audience configuration used in this example.</a></p>
