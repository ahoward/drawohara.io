  <p>as i‚Äôve intimated obliquely in some of my socials, i‚Äôve been working at <a href="https://syntheticecho.com" target="_blank">https://syntheticecho.com</a> for over 8 months on a system i‚Äôve named <code>disco</code>.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> is short for <strong>‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù</strong> and it brings a unique and important aspect to <strong>any</strong> AI application:</p>

<h5 id="the-social-voice">‚Äúthe social voice‚Äù</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p>what do you mean by that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i mean that we have compiled a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>currated, distilled, and augmented dataset of over a million high quality organic social conversations from around the internet</li>
  <li>from these we have extracted <code>hopes</code>, <code>fears</code>, <code>dreams</code>, and other goodness</li>
  <li>these conversations are organized into <code>audiences</code> and, to these, you can literally <em>ask any question</em></li>
</ul>

<p>but unlike google‚Äôs gemini, which aims to inform you in a way that sells ads, or openai, which aims to inform you with <em>democracy_ending</em> intell.  <code>disco</code> informs you with real conversations, from <em>real people</em>, and it gives the the citations for you to verify, for yourself, if you accept the line it‚Äôs feeding you.</p>

<p>in the examples above you can also notice, and this is just for the sake of example, that one can constrain the answer given to certain criteria.  for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>what did people think in 2024</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>what would a cynical or <em>negative</em> answer be to this question?</li>
</ul>

<p>and clearly, each is constrained to an audience.   these are pre-made but, under the covers, they are arbitrary collections of subreddits, authors, message boards, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i am so lost‚Ä¶.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>see <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/ae562567579a3e936d9b9bb7e4ffde88">this example of forty-two answers from <code>disco</code></a></p>

<p>this small example shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>giving <code>disco</code> a prompt, in this case <em>‚Äúwhat keeps you up at night‚Äù</em></li>
  <li>running this prompt by 42 disctinct audiences</li>
  <li>a sample of the citations used to inform each of the answers given, so you can <em>see for yourself</em></li>
</ul>

<p>this took about 5 minutes to run.  using <code>disco</code>, i can bring AI to bear on literally any task that should, or would be better, if informed by the social voice.</p>

<p>this includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running suveys on audiences prior to making a decision</li>
  <li>having specfic audiences read a proposal peice of content and give an honest review in thier own words</li>
  <li>examine the fears vs hopes of <em>science minded people</em> in 2024, vs. 2025</li>
  <li>mock elections</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>as little bit of technical background, this project was started with an ephasis on marketing but, it actually has a much, much broader applicability, not limited to politics, social issues, and product development.  any time you are using AI, or even if you aren‚Äôt, and you think <em>what if i could know what people with think about this</em> stop, <strong>because you can</strong>.   <em>apriori</em>.   perhaps not perfectly, but, very rapidly, you can, and should, bring millions of disparate, but real conversations to be bear on your question using the one ability AI actually has: <em>to reivew piles of human language and derive patterns out of it</em>.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> isn‚Äôt about getting ‚Äòthe right‚Äô answer, it is about <strong>knowing what people think the answer is</strong>.</p>

<p>every entreprenuer understands the difference.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> started out as an RHLF process but, since, has evolved into what amounts to two unique approaches from an IP perspetive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it uses and clever process to discover not <em>what is commonly accepted and said</em> about <em>anything</em> but, instead, is able to identify <em>significant clusterthe s of outliers</em>.   in otherwords, it helps find the conversations that are most relevant to consider.  this is <em>vastly</em> different than most AI approaches which aim to give you vanilla, book reporish, correct, and non-controversial answers.  <code>disco</code> does the opposite: it gives you are <em>real</em> answer, and backs it up with proof.  you be the judge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it uses a clever way of pre-indexing this information so reteriving it is a simple query and scales quite well</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>wut?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it‚Äôs ok. you aren‚Äôt a developer.  or a vc.  stop reading now.</p>

<p>but if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>please be aware that i am releasing an API, which will be single, simple endpoint, so that you can bring ‚Äòthe social voice‚Äô to your RAG pipelines with about 5, maybe 3 lines of code.  not matter which AI you use.  <a href="/contact">hmu</a> if you want a beta API key.  priorty on devs that are willing to share what they are doing with it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a demo app will be out in 7-10 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>i am working to indroduce the bluesky firehose.  goal is to be the authority on ‚Äòthe real voice‚Äô when it comes to the RLHF training data set wars which are about to ensue.  crytpgraphic guarantees about authorship and all.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
