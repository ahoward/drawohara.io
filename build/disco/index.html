  <p>as i‚Äôve hinted on some of my socials, i‚Äôve been working, since mid-2024, at
<a href="https://syntheticecho.com/">synthetic echo</a> on a system i‚Äôve named
<strong><code>disco</code></strong>.</p>

<p><code>disco</code></p>

<p>stands for <em>discovery</em>.</p>

<p>and it brings a unique, <em>critical</em>, and beneficial aspect to <em>many</em> AI applications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>the social voice</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>below are three examples of running some questions by <code>disco</code>.</p>

<p>in each case, the answers you‚Äôll see were informed by bringing millions of
<em>real conversations</em> had by <em>real humans</em> to bear on the question at hand.</p>

<p>this is in stark contrast to ‚Äònormal‚Äô AI, which instead presents the user with
an amortized, book reportish, standard, and non-controversial answer to your
query.</p>

<p>and that, my dear reader, with the personality of a toaster oven.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> isn‚Äôt about being being <em>objectively correct</em>, it‚Äôs not trying to
<em>tell you what to think</em>.</p>

<p>instead.  it uses the power of AI to tell you <em>what people think</em>.</p>

<p>this way, you can make an informed decision for yourself, after examinging the
multitude of opinions out there.</p>

<p><code>disco</code>‚Äôs goal is to be <em>subjectively correct</em>: to accurately reflect the
voices of people.</p>

<p>this is in stark contract to commerical AI, which aims to give you the most
vanilla answer, with a bias towards those that motivate you to purchase, or,
at minimum, to stay on the platforms of thier affiliate companies.</p>

<p><code>disco</code> pulls no punches.</p>

<p>because most questions have a <em>variety</em> of correct answers, <em>depending on who
you ask</em>.  <code>disco</code> shows you this variety, and it reveals <em>who</em> would have
been likely to provide that type of answer, with <em>references</em> to the source
material it used to form that conclusion.</p>

<p>in this way, you can just <em>read it and weep</em> ;-)</p>

<p>technically, and as astute readers will have no doubt noticied, it is through
these citations that <code>disco</code> provides <em>verficiation of non-hallucination</em>.</p>

<p>without further ado, here are those examples.</p>

<p>please take some time to review the output, which provides the answers of <em>42
discrete audiences</em>.</p>

<p>pay careful attention not only to the citations provided which, as you shall
see, provide support for the answers given.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/4779d5df4799bb9c2eb1622e00fa8ab0">What keeps you up at night?</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/6ac03564a43f6b49428659b93da74de3">What is your biggest concern about the environment?</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/59b525a24807ba2caf4f921471015ffb">What is your feeling towards the fortune 500?</a></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>as you‚Äôve hopefully realized, after reviewing the above, <code>disco</code> is not your
mother‚Äôs AI.</p>

<p>it‚Äôs a lot more honest, a lot more realitic, and it‚Äôs grounded in real human
conversation.</p>

<p>disco has many applications.  essentially, <em>any</em> AI application that could,
would, or should benefit from consideration of the <em>social voice</em>.</p>

<p>this includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>running dynamic, real-time, surveys across audiences before making business decisions.</li>
  <li>having specific audiences review proposals or generated content and give honest feedback, in their own words.</li>
  <li>mocking national elections.</li>
  <li>understanding unfiltered thoughts about your company, practice, or brand, including dangerous or otherwise censored information (we have 4chan‚Ä¶)</li>
  <li><em>actually</em> understanding the nuances of the social conversation, instead of counting clicks, keywords, and search terms.</li>
  <li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>the above was a simple demonstration.  the technology can be brought to
bear on any problem a general purpose AI can be.  which is to say, almost all
of them.</p>

<p>as present, i am working hard to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add substack content to <code>disco</code></li>
  <li>add bluesky content to <code>disco</code></li>
  <li>release an API that developers can use to integrate <code>disco</code>s RAG context in thier own AI applications</li>
  <li>release a basic UI for non-technical people to leverage <code>disco</code></li>
  <li>produce a threat index of the fortune 500 using 4chan, and other ‚Äògray‚Äô sources</li>
  <li>raising a round</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/contact">reach out</a> if you wanna stay in touch regarding the project.</p>

<p>ps. for the curious, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ahoward/95093a816c9a3f752f9d8ec421f24be5">here‚Äôs the audience configuration used in these examples.</a></p>

<p>pss. yes, i support custom audiences of arbitrary data sources and authors.  segments #ftw</p>
