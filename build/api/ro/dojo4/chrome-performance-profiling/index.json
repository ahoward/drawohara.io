We always try to use best practices so we don’t usually have an issue with performance, but it’s a very good skill to learn.</p>\n\n<p>I was impressed with google’s documentation on the subject since they’ve re-done the developer website. Instead of writing an introduction to chrome performance gauging and debugging, it’s more valuable to link to their excellent documentation:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/</a></p>\n\n</div>\n",
