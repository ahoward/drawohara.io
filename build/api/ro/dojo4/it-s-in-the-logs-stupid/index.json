The site worked fine in development/staging, but the index was taking upwards of 10 seconds to render in production.</p>\n\n<p>Because it worked outside of production we leapt to the conclusion it was related to the hosting infrastructure. We checked Apache, Passenger, server load, network configuration, and so on. Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I thought to check <code>log/production.log</code>, and there is was:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Processing by BlahController#index as */*\n  Rendered blah/_carousel.html.erb (5795.2ms)\n  Rendered blah/index.html.erb within layouts/site (5801.5ms)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We quickly tracked it down some image processing that wasn’t being cached. It didn’t show outside of production because the image assets were different. I won’t bore you with the details.</p>\n\n<p>However, I will <del>bore</del> enlighten you as to my point. When debugging a problem, start with the simple things. The Rails logs aren’t very detailed, but they provide more than enough information to quickly drill down to problems in your code.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
