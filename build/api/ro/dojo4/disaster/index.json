Rather, I just dropped 4k on a blazing fast new 15” MBP and launched into recovery…</p>\n\n<p>Here is a brief outline of my current backup strategy, mixed with some thoughts about how managing data is changing fast:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>apps are managing your data more than ever.  use this to your advantage.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>full-on backups are stupid.  you need to be selective to restore fast.  this takes brain power.  what is faster to restore after a crash vs re-install?  what’s simpler to re-install vs. re-configure?  hint: data not code and configuration.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>operating systems move faster than your backup software: you should only be backing up data and not configuration or, worse, binary information.  dot files are an exception of course!</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>google is king for email, contacts, and cal.  drop any other solutions.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>use git for you codez.  don’t back it up.  move on.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>use things.app or something cloud based for your productivy.  non-syncing todo lists are dead.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>owning music is an old fashioned idea.  use rdio, sspotify, or as a last resort iCloud.  but definitely make sure that you have no reason to backup your music.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>pictures are a bitch.   this is an RFP for suggestions.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>movies.  movies shouldn’t be on a devleopers box.  there, i said it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>dropbox.  use this for everything else and eschew your operating system’s silly built-in mechanisms.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Summary:</p>\n\n<p>1) use clould based applications</p>\n\n<p>2) owning music and movies is a silly concept.  leave it.</p>\n\n<p>3) put everything else into dropbox</p>\n\n</div>\n",
