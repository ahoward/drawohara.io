St. Patrick’s day was the first such opportunity to give this a go. We rolled out the green and were mighty pleased with ourselves as we sipped giant steins of Guinness.</p>\n\n<p>Then, disaster struck. We learned of the lame <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/17/no-brewers-and-no-mayor-in-new-yorks-st-patricks-day-parade/\">situations</a> in New York Citay and Boston where LGBTQ folks (in particular gay vets) were being excluded from marching in the parade. This led to a boycott of the parades by mayors and brewers alike. We too were all like, “not on my watch, suckas.” We took down the green. Peace was restored.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn’t long before we started to miss the green like a leprechaun misses his pot of gold. We wanted it back, but we didn’t want to seem like we were giving in.</p>\n\n<p>We reevaluated the situation and decided that in this particular instance, doing something was going to make more of a statement than doing nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the green is back and badder than ever. And to make sure we’re not misunderstood, we added a little rainbow to the logo… ya know, ‘cause leprechauns love rainbows.</p>\n\n<p>Happy St. Paddy’s Day!!</p>\n\n</div>\n",
