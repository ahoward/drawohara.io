I’d start the song over and give you my other earbud so we can listen together, but you’re across town or across the country or across the world. Too sad!</p>\n\n<p>We helped <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/youngbrad\">Brad Young</a> solve this problem by building <a href=\"http://gosyncd.com/\">GoSyncd</a>, a music sharing platform that allows you to share any track from <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com\">SoundCloud</a> in real-time with anyone and everyone. <a href=\"http://gosyncd.com/\">GoSyncd</a> just launched this week with this promise: “You’ll never share headphones again. Same song. Same time. All your friends.”</p>\n\n<p>The project provided some interesting challenges around syncing and gave us a chance to play with the <a href=\"https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide\">SoundCloud API</a>. It was also the first time we’ve used <a href=\"https://pusher.com/\">Pusher</a> for a project. The service simplifies sending notifications between servers and browsers and directly between browsers. There are lots of ways to do this, but <a href=\"https://pusher.com/\">Pusher</a> provides a clean API and falls back to handle browsers that don’t modern notification techniques</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gosyncd.com/\">GoSyncd</a> is a nice interface for searching for and playing music from SoundCloud. It was fun to build and makes it even more sweet to listen together!</p>\n\n</div>\n",
