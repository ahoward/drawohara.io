After that, we’ll be picking our next project to get started on the following week. Part of our process is <a href=\"http://gomoshimoshi.com/ideas.html\">soliciting ideas</a> from you, the reader. It’s not stealing because you give it to us and get to see it built. (If you want to be more involved than just giving us your brilliant idea, let us know and we’ll listen.)</p>\n\n<p>So far the moshimoshico process has been going well. We’re building products. We’re having fun. And we’ll be posting more about it (and more regularly) soon…</p>\n\n</div>\n",
