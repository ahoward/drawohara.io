      "body": "<p>\r\n  Since we're hiring at dojo4, I thought I'd put together a little tip sheet on how to get and keep a job here. Heck, they hired Garett, so why not you?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. When applying, ask for the paper application</h2>\r\n\r\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;margin:1em\"><img src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/online-application.png' alt=\"Sample question from the online dojo4 job application\" style=\"border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;margin-bottom:10px\"><figcaption style=\"font-size:13px;font-style:italic\">\r\n    Sample question from the online dojo4 job application\r\n  </figcaption></figure><p>\r\n  It's a little known fact that dojo4 allows job applicants to submit paper applications. There's a lot of mumbo jumbo about having a robust GitHub repetoire, but that's total BS.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"highlight\">\r\n  ...As is the online application, which is riven with trick questions.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Case in point, when I filled the thing out, one of the questions was \"Have you ever been charged with a felony? If no, why not?\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  I'm pretty sure the whole process is illegal, but at least on the paper application you can answer in crayon—super-helpful for writing out source code. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Whatever you do, don't agree to an in-person interview at Ara's house</h2>\r\n\r\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em\"><img style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/outhouse.jpg' alt=\"Ara's double-decker outhouse\"><figcaption style=\"font-size:13px;font-style:italic\">\r\n    Ara's \"double-decker\" outhouse\r\n  </figcaption></figure><p>\r\n  Again, totally illegal. You'd think candidates would smell the trap from a mile away, especially when they're asked to bring \"old trousers and a tyvek suit\", but no.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  You see, folks, Ara is from Alaska, and despite having perfectly adequate plumbing at home, he requires family and friends to use his one-of-a-kind \"double-decker\" outhouse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Naturally, the thing needs regular maintenance. Hence, the tyvek suit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  To date, three candidates have fallen in. They remain interred side-by-side.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. After you're hired, don't let Anthony talk you into going out for a beer</h2>\r\n\r\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;margin:1em 0\"><div class=\"flex-video youtube widescreen\">\r\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/iKqGXeX9LhQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <figcaption style=\"font-size:13px;font-style:italic\">\r\n    Steve after a night on the town with Anthony\r\n  </figcaption></figure><p>\r\n  People who visit our office often fail to notice the handsome, soft-spoken designer in the back room. Those who do just assume he's another Boulder <i>artiste</i> whiling away the hours making the world more beautiful.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Anthony's not just another hipster with questionable sartorial tastes; he's one of the power elite—a lifetime member of Yale's infamous <i>Skull and Bones</i> secret society—not to mention a world-class drinker. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  During my first week on the job, I made the mistake of going out with him for a \"quick beer\" after work and woke up the next day in my boxers astride the waterfall at Coors Field with a dojo4 brand on my inner thigh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Guy's an animal. Beware.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Play an active role in the community</h2>\r\n\r\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em\"><img style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/peter-sign.jpg' alt=\"Wallflowers and introverts need not apply\"><figcaption style=\"font-size:13px;font-style:italic\">\r\n    Wallflowers and introverts need not apply\r\n  </figcaption></figure><p>\r\n  To ensure a tech biz stays relevant these days you have to foster innovation, nourish experimentation, and plant as many seeds in the community as possible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Our Creative Director, Peter McEwen, has taken this to the next level with a plan to keep dojo4 in the public eye and develop the next generation of creative employee.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The details of the plan are, naturally, under NDA, but he assures us he's laying the foundation every night after he goes home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>5. When Corey says jump, you say \"How high?\"</h2>\r\n\r\n<figure style=\"text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em\"><img style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/signs.jpg' alt=\"dojo4 doesn't give a rat's ass about your health and happiness\"><figcaption style=\"font-size:13px;font-style:italic\">\r\n    dojo4 doesn't give a rat's ass about your health and happiness\r\n  </figcaption></figure><p>\r\n  Most offices strive to create a safe space where employees feel comfortable sharing ideas and contributing to a healthy atmosphere. Not so at dojo4.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Despite numerous blog posts extolling the virtues of a healthy workplace (<a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/have-babies-at-dojo4\">Exhibit A</a>, <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/beginning-and-ending-properly\">Exhibit B</a>, yadda-yadda-yadda), Corey's contention is that \"a fearful employee is an obedient employee.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  In point of fact, we're currently doing an office-wide \"organizational development workshop\" led by inmates from one of the state's supermax prisons.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  I have no idea how learning to fashion a shank from corn forks and pruno is a team-building exercise, but I've learned to keep my mouth shut. You should too if you want to see your next birthday.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Good luck.\r\n</p>",
