It helps us understand ourselves each other better. Recently the question was: what makes an exemplary leader? This question starts to get at the heart of what leadership is. What does it mean to be a leader? How do we lead well in our own lives, not just for others but for ourselves. I thought the answers harvested for our motley crew worth sharing:</p>\n\n<p>An exemplary leader…</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>has impeccable ethics.</li>\n  <li>projects calm at the center of the storm.</li>\n  <li>is someone who is not motivated by the desire to be liked, nor the fear of being disliked.</li>\n  <li>understands that there is one mountain, but many passes.</li>\n  <li>has integrity and the ability to hold a path in the face of adversity.</li>\n  <li>can communicate effectively the reasons why a decision was made.</li>\n  <li>will do the dirtiest work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n",
