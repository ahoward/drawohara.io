(publishing the abstraction and soliciting feedback)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>developer merges pull request for ‘divide-by-zero’ bug several days later (using feedback to further understanding)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>in the end developer one checks of a box and strenghtens his team’s process.  developer two strenghtens the code, the team and, most of all, himself.</p>\n\n<p>by repeating the process over and over developer one can transform himself in developer two by repeated working to strengthen technical and domain muscles.  conversely, developer two can stop training and become soft like developer one.</p>\n\n<p>developer ability is just like muscle: you’ve got to use it or loose it.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",
