In case you’re unfamiliar, Cross Cultured runs a membership program for young, culturally curious individuals that gives access to a special event series at some of the various arts institutions around Denver. This summer, the program will run until October 31st. It’s not too late to check out their <a href=\"https://crosscultured.org/events\">list of remaining events</a> and <a href=\"https://crosscultured.org/signup\">become a member</a>!</p>\n\n<p>dojo4 and <a href=\"http://gomoshimoshi.com/\">Moshi Moshi Co.</a> had a chance to help out Cross Cultured throughout the springtime by collaborating on their web presence and membership backend. Here are few highlights:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Mobile Friendly: utilizing <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">industry-recognized tools</a>, we quickly built a site that feels good on all devices</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://stripe.com/checkout\">Stripe Checkout Integration</a>: they can easily track revenue, manage discounts, and issue refunds</li>\n  <li>Content/Data Management: Cross Cultured staff can login and manage all the necessary content and data to drive their homepage, events, and member program</li>\n  <li>Reporting: Their back-office work is streamlined through detailed and exportable reporting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This was really enjoyable for us because we got to leverage our expertise and past experience to build up a deserving organization and cause.
