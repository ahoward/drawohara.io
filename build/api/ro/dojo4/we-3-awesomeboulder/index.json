So awesome, that there’s a group of amazing people working to make Boulder even awesome-er and we at dojo4 help them any way we can.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org\">Awesome Boulder</a> is the local chapter of the <a href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/\">Awesome Foundation</a>, which grants $1,000 a month to local projects working to improve the community in some way. AwesomeBoulder has been running for 25 months and funded 25 projects for a total of $25,000 given out to local projects. You can see the full list of funded projects on <a href=\"http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/boulder\">their chapter page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Dojo4 believes in this organization, so we help out by acting on their board of trustees, making a monthly monetary donation, and hosting all of their events and meetings at our office. We also improved their website at awesomeboulder.org pro-bono. Their site started as a simple landing page with an explanation and a link to apply at the Awesome Foundation’s website.</p>\n\n<p>The page did a good job of explaining the process of getting funded, but a major administrative challenge was reminding each donor to write a check each month to Awesome Boulder. So we turned their landing page into a full Rails app so that they could allow their donors to automatically make their contribution each month. This change also allows them to build and publish a blog, and have flexibility over their application process should they want to change it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>We’re looking forward to seeing what awesome projects they support next!</p>\n\n</div>\n",
