There was a small flurry of media activity about the project -- first <a href=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_20299085/photographer-unleashes-photo-graffiti-project-effort-keep-boulder\" title=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_20299085/photographer-unleashes-photo-graffiti-project-effort-keep-boulder\">the Daily Camera picked it up</a> (and filmed a video of me talking about the photo), then <a href=\"http://www.thedenveregotist.com/news/local/2012/april/6/boulder-my-gallery\" title=\"http://www.thedenveregotist.com/news/local/2012/april/6/boulder-my-gallery\">the Denver Egotist reposted the video</a>, and finally <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/boulder-photo-graffiti-project_n_1408386.html#s848470&amp;title=Boulder_Photo_Graffiti\" title=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/boulder-photo-graffiti-project_n_1408386.html#s848470&amp;title=Boulder_Photo_Graffiti\">the Huffington Post reposted the video</a>.&#160;</p>\n<p>Of course, by that time the picture in question was long gone, \"stolen\" as the placard suggests. It hung behind dojo4 for just two nights.</p>\n<p>We thought the story was over, and we hoped it generated some fun for the <a href=\"http://photograffitiboulder.wordpress.com/about/\" title=\"http://photograffitiboulder.wordpress.com/about/\">artist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org/\" title=\"http://www.awesomeboulder.org/\">sponsor</a> behind the project. But it hasn't ended.</p>\n<p>This morning while a few of us were down at <a href=\"http://boxcarcoffeeroasters.com/\" title=\"http://boxcarcoffeeroasters.com/\">Boxcar Coffee</a>, a Boulder Open Space ranger drove up to dojo4 and left something on the porch. The Ruby hackers hanging out saw it happen, and they took the unexpected delivery inside.</p>\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/a-sequel/assets/img-20120418-090402.jpg' title=\"Img 20120418 090402\" alt=\"Img 20120418 090402\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p>Those are the facts. Beyond them is merely conjecture. But the piece now greeting you as you enter dojo4 (\"Waiting\") was <a href=\"http://photograffitiboulder.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/final-installation/\" title=\"http://photograffitiboulder.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/final-installation/\">once hung elsewhere</a>. It appears we \"stole\" it using pure hacker guile: We're the only entity associated with this project whose address can be easily found online, and for some searches we're the first result. Talk about black-hat SEO!</p>\n<p>The placard remains, so we cannot guarantee this piece will not follow the first one into an unknown private collection. But for now, you can view it weekdays during business hours. C'mon by!</p>\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/a-sequel/assets/img-20120418-090411.jpg' title=\"Img 20120418 090411\" alt=\"Img 20120418 090411\" rel=\"450x450\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>",
