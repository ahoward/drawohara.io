Select New Mexico is a green chile distributor who wanted a refresh of their web site. It is a great example of the breath of services that Dojo4 provides. Peter designed it, Corey took product photos, Steve built the HTML and CSS and I added transitions and animations to it.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a beautiful, simple web site that celebrates hatch green chiles and makes hungry for a large bowl of pork green chili.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
