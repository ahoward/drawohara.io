We stand in a circle. We <a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/MUeQeEQaDCjE4/giphy.gif\">bow</a>. We <a href=\"http://clap.resn.co.nz/\">clap</a>. We do a minute of <a href=\"http://sitillustrated.com/images/snore-top-meditator-meditation-cartoon.gif\">silent meditation</a>. One person asks a question that helps us know and understand each other better. We’ve had easy questions and hard questions, poignant questions and silly questions. We use the guidelines of <a href=\"http://www.centerforcouncil.org/what-is-council.html\">council</a> as the framework to answer the question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>speak from the heart</li>\n  <li>listen completely</li>\n  <li>be spontaneous</li>\n  <li>be lean</li>\n  <li>everything is confidential</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And we signal the end with a clap and a bow and then we all have lunch together.</p>\n\n<p>We do it every week, whether there are 2 of us or 12 of us. We do it with guests. We do it whether we’re busy or not. It’s part of how we’ve overcome the inevitable seasickness that comes with the swells and dips of being a small business. No doubt, it’s made us a better business.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",
