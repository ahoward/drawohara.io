Problems like where to get our coffee from (<a href=\"http://boxcarcoffeeroasters.com/\">Boxcar</a>), where to go for lunch, what editor to use (Vim).</p>\n\n<p>We also struggled with how to manage who has access to our development, staging and production servers. We went through a few iterations attempting to solve this problem. We then hit two realizations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Everyone that develop and deploy code are in a single team on GitHub</li>\n  <li>GitHub provides access to the <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/v3/users/keys/\">public SSH key for their user via their API</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It turns out that SSH <em>public</em> keys are indeed <strong>public</strong>. The impending arrival of <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/miles-smiles\">Miles Matthias</a> provided the motivation to act on this insight. <a href=\"https://github.com/fredjean/lockpick\">lockpick</a> came out of that realization.</p>\n\n<p>We now have the <code>lockpick</code> script on a cron job. Any member of the dojo4 and trusted sub team now has access to our servers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fredjean/lockpick\">lockpick</a> is open source software and is licensed under the MIT license.</p>\n\n<p>â€“</p>\n\n<p>Image from <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ranh/\">Ran Yaniv Hartstein</a>, found on <a href=\"http://flickr.com\">Flickr</a> at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/71052670@N00/106709219/in/photolist-aqUW8-2NYNRp-3afgoE-56hKYh-6tsdur-6twmtW-7bBkEv-acmuGx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/71052670@N00/106709219/in/photolist-aqUW8-2NYNRp-3afgoE-56hKYh-6tsdur-6twmtW-7bBkEv-acmuGx</a></p>\n\n</div>\n",
