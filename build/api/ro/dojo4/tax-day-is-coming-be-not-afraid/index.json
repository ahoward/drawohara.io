But today the prevailing belief seems to be that artists suck at math, and visa versa.  While I disagree, I do know a lot of artists who seem averse to working with numbers.</p>\n\n<p>You know who you are.  You’re still teetering on the verge of <a href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/extension\">filing that extension</a>, even though Tax Day is less than a week away.</p>\n\n<p>Enter Rus Garofalo of <a href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/\">Brass Taxes</a>. He specializes in taxes for the self-employed, especially us artist-types.  DOJO4 had the opportunity to re-build the backend of <a href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/\">http://brasstaxes.com</a> this year, so we can honestly say: it works beautifully!</p>\n\n<p>Listen dear friends: having someone else file your taxes - someone who actually understands the IRS’ ever-changing rules - <em>is</em> your god-given right as an adult. Can’t afford it?  Planning to DIY with Turbo Tax?  Aside from being a tax write-off, Brass Taxes will be more fun and less expensive than Turbo Tax, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9fEm9Y0cpOI\">Rus explains in this video</a> (while wearing a diaper).</p>\n\n<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/tax-day-is-coming-be-not-afraid/assets/c.jpeg' alt=\"rus.jpeg\" /></p>\n\n<p>So go ahead, <a href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/extension\">file that extension</a> and make an appointment with Brass Taxes to put tax season behind you.  That way, if you’re in Colorado, you can go skiing this weekend.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n",
