Don’t believe it?  Check this out:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/4039805.js?file=polluted.rb.txt\"></script>\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>the results were produced using this script</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/4039805.js?file=polluted.rb\"></script>\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>some people have claimed that this will always be a side effect of having nice DSLs, but this is simply not true:</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/4040698.js?file=dsl.rb\"></script>\n<br /></p>\n\n<p>so, learn how to write DSLs the right way people.  the right way is any way that doesn’t dump methods all over ever object and namespace without an <em>extremely</em> good reason.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n“it should read nice” is <em>not</em> a good reason.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
