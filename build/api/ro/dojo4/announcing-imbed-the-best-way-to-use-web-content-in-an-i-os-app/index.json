      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Lots of times it makes sense to do some development in HTML, JS, and CSS, and then use that content in a native app. Phonegap claims to be the best solution for that case, but in <a href=\"http://dojo4.com/blog/why-phonegap-sucks\">my experience</a> it’s one of the worst.</p>\n\n<p>In response to Phonegap, I’ve open sourced our company’s starting repo for iOS apps that need to use some web content in a UIWebView, calling it <a href=\"https://github.com/dojo4/imbed\">Imbed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Small &amp; Open Source.</strong> One UIViewController, One HTML file, and the super small, 1 class, open source <a href=\"https://github.com/marcuswestin/WebViewJavascriptBridge\">WebViewJavascriptBridge</a> project.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Support any iOS feature immediately.</strong> No waiting for some third party developer to create a plugin. You’re writing native Objective-C code yourself. So as soon as Apple releases it, you can support it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Follow Apple’s guides, not someone else’s.</strong> Apple does a great job of documenting how to use the features of iOS. Most third party developers do not. Which one would you rather follow?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Automate everything with Rake.</strong> Focus on writing your code, testing it in the browser, and then automate everything else in a clear, open source Rakefile. Heck, even archive, ship to Testflight, and notify Campfire.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s your app. Don’t rely on some third party tool to support features that iOS already offers. Take your code by the horns.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dojo4/imbed/archive/master.zip\">Download Imbed</a> now.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
