      "body": "<div class=\"ro markdown\">\n  <p>Last week, our friends at Amplify launched their ambitious tablet product at <a href=\"http://sxswedu.com/\">SXSWedu</a>. You can check it out <a href=\"http://amplify.com/tablet/\">here</a>. Be sure to watch the video and grasp the whole scope of what they’re tackling. Isn’t it awesome?! Instant student and teacher feedback. Content where students spend their time: on devices and on the web. A more personalized education experience.</p>\n\n<p>dojo4 couldn’t be happier to contribute to this effort by building two content applications for student use. The first is an Encyclopædia Britannica application and the second is a Khan Academy video application. Both proved to be positive challenges with respect to student-focused usability and design, offline media, and Android development. We hope they see some good use!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding development of the EB application for Android, one of my favorite parts of the implementation was around search. A good encyclopedia application has to have good search, right? We ended up using SQLite since, with Android, it ships with the <a href=\"http://sqlite.org/fts3.html\">FTS4</a> extension compliled and enabled. If you haven’t used FTS4 virtual tables before, they provide great full-text search indexing capabilities and the <code>MATCH</code> SQL operator. The docs are a bit technical, but very helpful overall once you wrap your head around them.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more from Amplify’s CEO <a href=\"http://amplify.com/article/technology-thats-truly-designed-education\">here</a>.</p>\n\n</div>\n",
