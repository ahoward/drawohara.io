Ellen's budget and needs were both small, so we decided to build a quick one-page site showcasing all her content.</p>\n<p>Ellen's design inspirations included several culinary blogs with big, beautiful pictures of food. Anthony Dimitre brought that bold look into the page with a couple very nice carrots. </p>\n<p>Anthony also put together a nice logo that will flavor all of Planted Nutrition's other materials -- business cards, client packets, and more.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Planted Nutrition is a static web site built with <a title=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\" href=\"http://middlemanapp.com/\">Middleman</a>. We can't say enough about this tool. Static site generation isn't new, and Middleman isn't the first static site generator, but it is a <em>very good</em> tool. </p>\n<p>At dojo4 we're using Middleman as an alternative to the ubiquitous LAMP content management systems. There are several good LAMP CMS tools out there, but they aren't one-size-fits-all, and they all require some trade-offs. In this case, even a CMS as simple as Wordpress would be too complex and maintenance-heavy for Planted Nutrition's immediate needs.</p>\n<p>Someday, Planted Nutrition may want something more than a static site. But meanwhile, this tasty site is plenty. </p>\n</div>\n",
