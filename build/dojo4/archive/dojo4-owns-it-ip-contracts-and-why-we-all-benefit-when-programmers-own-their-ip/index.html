  <p>dojo4‚Äôs general services agreement that we sign with every client includes a clause that describes our IP and what we reserve the right to do with it (see below and <a href="https://github.com/dojo4/dojo4/blob/master/docs/dojo4IP_legalese" target="_blank">https://github.com/dojo4/dojo4/blob/master/docs/dojo4IP_legalese</a>). It says that we absolutely own our IP and that we can use it again and again to do work for our clients. It says that we can release it as open source and that we can build upon what we‚Äôve learned and developed in the past (including through client projects) to build more and even better things for ourselves and our clients.</p>

<p>At first blush, this can sometimes be disconcerting for some clients. Our contracts also specify that dojo4 irrevocably and unconditionally assigns to the client all rights, titles, and interests worldwide to each and every deliverable that that client pays for. But this can sometimes cause misunderstanding since our IP is nested in most deliverables we produce.</p>

<p>In a recent email exchange with a client, our CTO,<a href="http://http://dojo4.com/team/ara-t-howard">Ara Howard</a> explained his take on how this works:</p>

<p><em>‚Ä¶it‚Äôs precisely because of the extreme expense of both development and testing of  critical web components that foundational tools like bootstrap (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>) and eric meyer‚Äôs reset
(<a href="http://www.cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/" target="_blank">http://www.cssreset.com/scripts/eric-meyer-reset-css/</a>) are used on literally millions and millions of websites today.</em></p>

<p><em>They are:</em></p>

<p>*1. super expensive to create</p>
<ol>
  <li>super expensive to test</li>
  <li>super expensive to maintain*</li>
</ol>

<p><em>This why technologists share, and share alike when we reach for off-the-shelf functionality needed across a broad spectrum of projects.</em></p>

<p><em>Although we‚Äôre not a giant in the space, dojo4 has developed literally hundreds of tools that we‚Äôve open sourced, shared, and rely on to execute in the most professional way for our clients: <a href="https://github.com/ahoward" target="_blank">https://github.com/ahoward</a>, <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/imbed-for-android" target="_blank">http://dojo4.com/blog/imbed-for-android</a>, <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/the-shadow-world-of-css-tables" target="_blank">http://dojo4.com/blog/the-shadow-world-of-css-tables</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>etc.</em></p>

<p><em>If we could not share these foundational tools between projects our estimates would need to increase by a factor of 5-10, and time to market by a similar amount.</em></p>

<p><em>It‚Äôs because of this that we advise clients to let us use the mistakes and lessons from other difficult projects on theirs.</em></p>

<p><em>We‚Äôre happy not to, but the expense and time increases required are simply not able to be saddled by a majority of projects.</em></p>

<p>We believe that we all benefit from being able to own and share our IP freely.</p>

<p><strong>Excerpted from our general services agreement (feel free to use in yours!):</strong></p>

<p><em>dojo4 IP</em></p>

<p>(a) Client acknowledges and agrees that (i) dojo4 shall retain all
ownership and other rights in and to the dojo4 IP notwithstanding that
any such dojo4 IP may become known to Client in connection with any
Engagement Agreement or is integrated into or otherwise becomes a part
of any of the Deliverables; (ii) Client shall have no ownership
interest or title in or to dojo4 IP; and (iii) dojo4 shall be free to
use any of the dojo4 IP in connection with performing services or
producing deliverables for any third parties so long as it complies
with its confidentiality obligations set forth elsewhere herein.</p>

<p>(b) Client shall not (i) modify, create derivative works from,
reverse‚Äë¬≠engi¬≠neer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise translate
dojo4 IP in any manner;  (ii) disclose or distribute copies of dojo4
IP or any portion thereof to third parties except as permitted by the
applicable Engagement Agreement; (iii) reproduce the dojo4 IP or any
portion thereof in any form or medium, except as permitted by the
applicable Engagement Agreement; (iv) use the dojo4 IP for any purpose
not specifically authorized by the applicable Engagement Agreement or
this Agreement; or (v) remove any copyright notices, trademarks or
other proprietary legends appearing on or in the dojo4 IP.</p>

<p>note: In summary, dojo4 may to select abstract parts of work performed
to make open source when it makes sense, but will not make any part of
any work performed for the Client open source without their
permission. A significant amount of dojo4 projects, including work for
hire, contain components of previously open sourced work.</p>
