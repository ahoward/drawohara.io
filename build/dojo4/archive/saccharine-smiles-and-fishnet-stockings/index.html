      // Use 'turbo:load' which fires both after the initial page load and subsequent Turbo visits.
      document.addEventListener('turbo:load', function() {
        // console.log('turbo:load event fired - wrapping YouTube iframes'); // Optional debug log
        wrapYouTubeIframes();
      });

      // Option 2: Explicitly run on initial load (if not using defer/module or for extra safety)
      // If your script might run before Turbo is fully ready or if Turbo might be absent,
      // you might also call it directly or use DOMContentLoaded as a fallback/primary trigger.
      // However, 'turbo:load' *should* cover the initial load too. If you experience issues
      // where initial load isn't handled, uncomment the line below.
      // document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', wrapYouTubeIframes);


      // --- Handling Dynamically Added Iframes (Advanced) ---

      // The above listeners handle iframes present during the 'turbo:load' event.
      // If iframes are added *later* via JavaScript, Turbo Streams, Stimulus actions, etc.,
      // the 'turbo:load' event won't re-fire for those specific additions.
      // For those cases, you have a few options:

      // A) Manually call `wrapYouTubeIframes()` after you know new content containing iframes has been added.

      // B) Use a MutationObserver to automatically detect when *any* nodes are added to the page
      //    and check if they contain iframes that need wrapping. This is more robust but complex.
      /*
      const observerCallback = (mutationsList, observer) => {
        let needsWrap = false;
        for (const mutation of mutationsList) {
          if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
            for (const node of mutation.addedNodes) {

                  needsWrap = true;

  <p><small>‚ÄúSincerity - if you can fake that, you‚Äôve got it made.‚Äù ‚Äï George Burns</small></p>

<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/saccharine-smiles-and-fishnet-stockings/assets/b.jpeg' alt="IMG_2605.jpg" /> 
When Shakespeare wrote ‚ÄúMerchant of Venice‚Äù more than five centuries ago, he knew well that what‚Äôs on the outside is rarely the whole story - and yes, he wrote ‚Äúglisters‚Äù not ‚Äúglitters‚Äù:</p>

<p>All that glisters is not gold;</p>

<p>Often have you heard that told:</p>

<p>Many a man his life hath sold</p>

<p>But my outside to behold:</p>

<p>Gilded tombs do worms enfold.</p>

<p>But for some reason we still seem obsessed with the external illusions in life - car, clothes, hairdos, zip code‚Ä¶ And even as we challenge long standing social norms about race, sexual orientation, gender identification, discrimination, etc. we still spend a significant amount of time judging the proverbial book by its cover. And when I say ‚Äúwe,‚Äù I see myself in the picture.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAppearances matter.‚Äù ‚ÄúNever a second chance to make a first impression.‚Äù</p>

<p>A couple of Fridays ago I got a chance to share personally with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mindfullinvestors.com/who-we-are/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEH0EorUJ084k0Hh6q3VyO_8zEHoA">Stuart Rudick</a>¬†of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mindfullinvestors.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6OIAhlbWlT7QRae7EoSpkTyBRCQ">Mindfull Investors</a>. He had taken a mountain bike ride with @drawohara and was in town to visit his daughter, a student at CU, where he too had graduated way back when bands still rocked Tulagis and alcohol flowed on the Hill.</p>

<p>Not exactly sure where or how Ara and Stu first met, but Stu attended the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fitzpatrick_(musician)&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFNiYNY_fGXfe9SqJDmD1H3WeB1A">Michael Fitzpatrick</a>¬†house concert, a burgeoning cultural aspect of @dojo4‚Äôs unique practice of business through meaningful work, doing cool shit that matters and honoring people in the process.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know who Stu was when I first met him, but he had two essential qualities I appreciate - he looked straight and clearly into my eyes when he spoke; he paid attention when he listened.</p>

<p>Stu walked into dojo4 right before lunch on Friday; he had his dog with him, a cocker spaniel he ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù was his daughter‚Äôs. Friday lunch @dojo4 is the perfect time to be introduced to another evolving human. Before lunch, daily stand-up includes a community circle with a more personal question.</p>

<p>This is a weekly acknowledgement - something that gives each of us a chance to pause and think about ourselves, our loved ones, each other, our work, our community. A clap and a bow. One minute of silent contemplation. For those who have never meditated (or like to talk like I do), one minute of silence gives a much fuller sense of the breadth of 60 seconds.</p>

<p>Close your eyes and your mouth for a minute. Check it out. Notice your breath.</p>

<p>@coreykohn had the question: what is the best/worst, easiest/hardest thing for you about community?</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy selfishness.‚Äù</p>

<p>I forget exactly what Stu said though I knew he felt at home, welcomed in our community.</p>

<p>We ate middle eastern. We chatted. We knew some similar people, Miami transplants to SF, one a great friend who had recently moved back to Boulder. Something about who he was, what he projected gave me the sense that I wanted to know more. Ara had said he should check out my home invited him up to see my home and he came.</p>

<p>I showed him around, immensely proud of what I have built, but open with him about how the parts ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù greatly impact my love relationship, exacerbate some challenging feelings with neighbors not loving our shipping container meets recycled barn aesthetic.</p>

<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/saccharine-smiles-and-fishnet-stockings/assets/c.jpeg' alt="10390265_10152283620719601_5530823275928211179_n.jpg" /> 
In all fairness I‚Äôve done no landscaping, scraps of cut out container, weeds and construction detritus litter the yard, and a 20‚Äô Hyundai rusting shipping container graffitied with ‚ÄúLove Thy Neighbor‚Äù facing the street sits where a driveway once was. It‚Äôs waiting to become part of a garage/workshop.</p>

<p>When I tell people about this, I say the outside still looks like West, West Virginia.</p>

<p>Stu had another quality in the best longstanding relationships I‚Äôve had and the ones I‚Äôve created recently - no bullshit, self-effacing, direct and loving - even when that means honest feedback. He got close to me, looked straight into me and said: ‚ÄúMark, your house is a metaphor. You don‚Äôt see it. You must.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis place is so damn amazing on the inside. It‚Äôs you - creative and bold and beautiful. It‚Äôs what you clearly care the most about - what‚Äôs on the inside. But the outside is your shadow self. It‚Äôs this buffer you use to keep some from loving you in ways you want. Soften that a little. See what happens.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know about you, but this IS the communication I want.</p>

<p>I told him it was a filter, a filter I‚Äôd used effectively throughout my life. That the people who were willing to get beyond my sometimes gruff exterior were the ones I would more likely want to engage with.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI get that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut others who could really benefit from knowing you, might not be able to.‚Äù</p>

<p>Thank you, Stu. I‚Äôm thinking about that pretty deeply, and I might even take a shave.</p>
