<p>Here’s the context… It’s Friday at noon. We stand in a circle. We <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/MUeQeEQaDCjE4/giphy.gif">bow</a>. We <a href="http://clap.resn.co.nz/">clap</a>. We do a minute of <a href="http://sitillustrated.com/images/snore-top-meditator-meditation-cartoon.gif">silent meditation</a>. One person asks a question that helps us know and understand each other better. We’ve had easy questions and hard questions, poignant questions and silly questions. We use the guidelines of <a href="http://www.centerforcouncil.org/what-is-council.html">council</a> as the framework to answer the question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>speak from the heart</li>
  <li>listen completely</li>
  <li>be spontaneous</li>
  <li>be lean</li>
  <li>everything is confidential</li>
</ul>

<p>And we signal the end with a clap and a bow and then we all have lunch together.</p>

<p>We do it every week, whether there are 2 of us or 12 of us. We do it with guests. We do it whether we’re busy or not. It’s part of how we’ve overcome the inevitable seasickness that comes with the swells and dips of being a small business. No doubt, it’s made us a better business.</p>
