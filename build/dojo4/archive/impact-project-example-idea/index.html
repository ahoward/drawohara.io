<p>I was just hit up by a bum on the street today who asked me for spare change. I told him I didn‚Äôt have any. Then I saw his smartphone in his hand and asked him about it. He said it was an LG. It was in a nice case. I asked him if he had a decent ability to use his phone and he said yes. I told him that all my money basically flows through my phone now and if he had an app that could easily facilitate a small donation, I‚Äôd give him a few pieces of spare change. I told him to invent that app and he could make a million dollars instead of begging for spare change. He didn‚Äôt respond. I walked away.</p>

<p>I wondered if someone is already working on this. It looks like <a href="http://www.ctagroup.org/">these guys</a> are working on something similar in Silicon Valley but I think they‚Äôre missing the mark a bit by aiming to be the ‚Äúfirst place in America where homelessness doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù There are plenty of gated communities, small towns etc. where homelessness doesn‚Äôt exist. And, I don‚Äôt think this should even be the goal. The goal should be to facilitate a higher quality human experience for those living on the margins through smartphone technology, period.</p>

<p>These guys present this info-graphic that shows a lot of opportunity for purpose-driven entrepreneurs to help those among us in the most need. C‚Äômon, humanity, let‚Äôs fix the biggest problems human dignity as our next big thing.</p>

<p>My friend who I was walking with suggested I could perhaps just put a few bucks on the guy‚Äôs EBT card. ‚ÄúGreat Idea‚Äù</p>

<p>I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and/or help you create this vision for our brothers and sisters on the street.</p>
