<p>Today is my last day at Dojo4. It has an adventure full of ups and downs, challenging technologies and being surrounded by an amazing crew.</p>

<p>I first heard of the Dojo four years ago. I was attending a Ruby code and coffee event when Jeremy mentioned that he was going to work at the dojo. I asked about this mystical place but hesitated to visit at first. I eventually overcame that hesitation and became a frequent visitor. I must warn you: hanging out at the dojo puts you at high risk of working for the dojo. I eventually heard of a position that dojo4 was recruiting for. I applied and my fate was sealed.</p>

<p>I returned to the dojo a little more than a year later to join as a full time employee. Here, I had the chance to work with amazing clients on deeply interesting projects. There was iOS, infrastructure, front end, back end, ops, devops, noops opportunities. Lots of MVP, some ongoing maintenance.</p>

<p>Still, I was missing working at scale. So I answered the call of a local startup who already has a product and a steep growth curve who needed help with scaling, expanding and running their product. Dealing with millions of emails a day is going to force me to up my game to a few  levels.</p>

<p>It is bitter sweet to leave such a crew behind, but they’ll do just fine. They are amazing in their own ways.</p>

<p>I’ll post more details of my adventures on <a href="http://twitter.com/fredjean">my twitter feed</a> and <a href="http://fredjean.net">on my blog</a>. Stay posted!</p>
