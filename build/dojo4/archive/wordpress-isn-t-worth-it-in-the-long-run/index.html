  <p>One of our favorite clients, <a href="http://gnip.com">Gnip</a> (recently <a href="https://blog.gnip.com/gnip-twitter-join-forces/">acquired by Twitter</a>), leans on us for all of their marketing design and websites, including <a href="http://gnip.com">gnip.com</a>, <a href="https://blog.gnip.com">blog.gnip.com</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.gnip.com">engineering.gnip.com</a>.</p>

<p>Their two blogs are WordPress instances (remnants of a pre-dojo4 legacy) that never seemed to be worth the effort to migrate out of WordPress at the time.</p>

<p><a href="http://gnip.com">Gnip.com</a> however is a fully static website built with Middleman and hosted on S3 and CloudFront. We made this recommendation after building and hosting a full-fledged Rails application for their site and noticing that their site would be a perfect candidate for a simple static site. The factors that tipped us off to this are the same for any other static site: no user accounts, speed and uptime are the highest priority, and so few updates that an admin interface is overkill (although with our static site, dojo4.com, we built <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/static-is-the-new-black">a webhook to listen for blog post publishes</a>).</p>

<p>We had one interesting question though - since we‚Äôre training the marketing team how to use this website, not developers, what kind of reactions would they have in experiencing both the admin-heavy side of WordPress (for their blogs) versus updating code in the middleman site (for gnip.com) and deploying via the command line?</p>

<p>Turns out they love the middleman setup and wish we would have switched their blogs over to middleman instead of WordPress years ago.</p>

<p>WordPress has one feature - an interface to draft and publish content that people are familiar with. Ignoring the <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/irish-dance-and-wordpress-the-soul-destroyer">emotional turmoil</a> of WordPress for a second, the maintenance cost and effort for a WordPress site are astounding for a medium to large company.</p>

<p>Plugins seem like a good shortcut to add functionality to your site until you have to modify or update one because it hasn‚Äôt been updated in 2 years. When Gnip was acquired by Twitter, the security team at Twitter wanted the blogs to ensure all content was over HTTPS. It‚Äôs a simple request, but when you have 25 WordPress plugins that are including their own resources, many of which don‚Äôt even support HTTPS, it‚Äôs a monster headache. Whereas with our static, Middleman approach, we do a quick search and replace in the code (and from the beginning, only using local resources or ones from reputable sources that do support HTTPS, like Google), deploy, and we‚Äôre done.</p>

<p>When you take the time to help people learn simple skills like HTML, CSS, and Javascript (which are nearly required skills to learn if you‚Äôre involved in tech at all - regardless of your job title), the drawbacks of WordPress become way more than is acceptable when there‚Äôs such a simple and powerful option in static web content and hosting.</p>
