    <em>published on: 2013-03-20</em>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Since we're hiring at dojo4, I thought I'd put together a little tip sheet on how to get and keep a job here. Heck, they hired Garett, so why not you?
</p>

<h2>1. When applying, ask for the paper application</h2>

<figure style="text-align:center;margin:1em"><img src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/online-application.png' alt="Sample question from the online dojo4 job application" style="border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;margin-bottom:10px"><figcaption style="font-size:13px;font-style:italic">
    Sample question from the online dojo4 job application
  </figcaption></figure><p>
  It's a little known fact that dojo4 allows job applicants to submit paper applications. There's a lot of mumbo jumbo about having a robust GitHub repetoire, but that's total BS.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
  ...As is the online application, which is riven with trick questions.
</p> 

<p>
  Case in point, when I filled the thing out, one of the questions was "Have you ever been charged with a felony? If no, why not?"
</p>

<p>
  I'm pretty sure the whole process is illegal, but at least on the paper application you can answer in crayon‚Äîsuper-helpful for writing out source code. 
</p>

<h2>2. Whatever you do, don't agree to an in-person interview at Ara's house</h2>

<figure style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em"><img style="margin-bottom:10px;" src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/outhouse.jpg' alt="Ara's double-decker outhouse"><figcaption style="font-size:13px;font-style:italic">
    Ara's "double-decker" outhouse
  </figcaption></figure><p>
  Again, totally illegal. You'd think candidates would smell the trap from a mile away, especially when they're asked to bring "old trousers and a tyvek suit", but no.
</p>

<p>
  You see, folks, Ara is from Alaska, and despite having perfectly adequate plumbing at home, he requires family and friends to use his one-of-a-kind "double-decker" outhouse.
</p>

<p>
  Naturally, the thing needs regular maintenance. Hence, the tyvek suit.
</p>

<p>
  To date, three candidates have fallen in. They remain interred side-by-side.
</p>

<h2>3. After you're hired, don't let Anthony talk you into going out for a beer</h2>

<figure style="text-align:center;margin:1em 0"><div class="flex-video youtube widescreen">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iKqGXeX9LhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <figcaption style="font-size:13px;font-style:italic">
    Steve after a night on the town with Anthony
  </figcaption></figure><p>
  People who visit our office often fail to notice the handsome, soft-spoken designer in the back room. Those who do just assume he's another Boulder <i>artiste</i> whiling away the hours making the world more beautiful.
</p>

<p>
  Nothing could be further from the truth.
</p>

<p>
  Anthony's not just another hipster with questionable sartorial tastes; he's one of the power elite‚Äîa lifetime member of Yale's infamous <i>Skull and Bones</i> secret society‚Äînot to mention a world-class drinker. 
</p>

<p>
  During my first week on the job, I made the mistake of going out with him for a "quick beer" after work and woke up the next day in my boxers astride the waterfall at Coors Field with a dojo4 brand on my inner thigh.
</p>

<p>
  Guy's an animal. Beware.
</p>

<h2>4. Play an active role in the community</h2>

<figure style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em"><img style="margin-bottom:10px;" src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/peter-sign.jpg' alt="Wallflowers and introverts need not apply"><figcaption style="font-size:13px;font-style:italic">
    Wallflowers and introverts need not apply
  </figcaption></figure><p>
  To ensure a tech biz stays relevant these days you have to foster innovation, nourish experimentation, and plant as many seeds in the community as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Our Creative Director, Peter McEwen, has taken this to the next level with a plan to keep dojo4 in the public eye and develop the next generation of creative employee.
</p>

<p>
  The details of the plan are, naturally, under NDA, but he assures us he's laying the foundation every night after he goes home.
</p>


<h2>5. When Corey says jump, you say "How high?"</h2>

<figure style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em"><img style="margin-bottom:10px;" src='/ro/dojo4/five-tips-for-obtaining-and-retaining-a-job-at-dojo4/assets/signs.jpg' alt="dojo4 doesn't give a rat's ass about your health and happiness"><figcaption style="font-size:13px;font-style:italic">
    dojo4 doesn't give a rat's ass about your health and happiness
  </figcaption></figure><p>
  Most offices strive to create a safe space where employees feel comfortable sharing ideas and contributing to a healthy atmosphere. Not so at dojo4.
</p>

<p>
  Despite numerous blog posts extolling the virtues of a healthy workplace (<a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/have-babies-at-dojo4">Exhibit A</a>, <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/beginning-and-ending-properly">Exhibit B</a>, yadda-yadda-yadda), Corey's contention is that "a fearful employee is an obedient employee."
</p>

<p>
  In point of fact, we're currently doing an office-wide "organizational development workshop" led by inmates from one of the state's supermax prisons.
</p>

<p>
  I have no idea how learning to fashion a shank from corn forks and pruno is a team-building exercise, but I've learned to keep my mouth shut. You should too if you want to see your next birthday.
</p>

<p>
  Good luck.
