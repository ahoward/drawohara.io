  following is an excerpt from an internal email
  
  sent to team dojo4 team members
  
  regarding what being a project lead means at dojo4 
 </pre>

<p>as some of you may have noticed, we designate ‚Äòlead‚Äô in the [STATUS] update.</p>

<p>probably what this precisely means hasn‚Äôt been clear enough in the past.</p>

<p>this message aims to rectify any confusion.</p>

<p>without further ado:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that it ships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that it ships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that it ships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means you are constantly aware of the budget.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you have a mental mind-map of the whole damn thing.<br />
in your sleep.  on sunday.  at 10:31 pm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you plan your weekends and vacations around the<br />
project.  you can hand it off.  but you cannot just drop it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you constantly upsell.  @dojo4 this just means<br />
looking for shit that needs or should be done, that we can excellently do,<br />
that the client isn‚Äôt aware of.  sales @dojo4 is normally just exchanging<br />
‚Äòwe can do‚Äô for ‚Äòyou need to do‚Äô in the context of a running project.  for<br />
@dojo4 sales this should always represent ‚Äúacting in the client‚Äôs<br />
best interest‚Äù to see <em>in advance</em>, what your personal professional<br />
capacity allows you to see - that the client does not yet see.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means cutting the hell out of internal waste.  you should<br />
fight, yell, and scream to reduce internal waste.  we make money by being<br />
excellent and shipping code.  look for waste from the client‚Äôs perspective<br />
and kill it dead.  if you can reduce a project‚Äôs spending from 100k to 10k<br />
just do it.  they‚Äôll be back with other awesome projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you <em>aggressively</em> delegate and recruit when you<br />
can‚Äôt do something yourself.  you may have to fight for the resources you<br />
need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you relish, and encourage, communication with the<br />
client whenever the client feels like it.  or, whenever and however you‚Äôve<br />
agreed and patiently trained the client to communicate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you identify with, care for, and empathize with,<br />
our clients.  their checks feed our families. and their ideas stimulate<br />
our own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that, when the shit hits the fan, you will do it all<br />
youself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being a lead means that you put it all into perspective: our projects<br />
seldom have lives hanging in the balance - you must manage your own<br />
relationship with the crises, real or perceived, that always - always -<br />
occur in the lifecyles of technology production.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>not everyone wants to be a project lead.</p>

<p>project leads don‚Äôt want to captain every project they‚Äôre involved with.</p>

<p>we need all kinds @dojo4.</p>

<p>if you feel remotely uncomfortable being thrust into a ‚Äòlead‚Äô role on a<br />
project, or desparately desire that role on another project, talk with your<br />
team and adjust.</p>

<p>everyone needs to be clear, comfortable, and capable in their roles.</p>
