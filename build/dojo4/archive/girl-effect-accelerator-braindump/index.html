  <p>i‚Äôve just spent the last 10 days in and around san francisco for the inaugural girl effect accelerator: the first unreasonable institute program dedicated to helping companies that make a positive impact on the lives of millions adolescent girls do so better and faster through social entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>there are so many totally amazing learnings that came out of this event, and i have a long form post drafted now, but i thought i‚Äôd jot down a sneak peak during a flight where i‚Äôm as happy to be flying home to my colorado family as i am sad to be leaving my new unreasonable one ;-) === ;-(</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>every person at this camp works at least twice as hard as every other person i know‚Ä¶</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7 people and luggage actually do fit in a prius‚Ä¶</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>i‚Äôd be remiss not to make sincere shout out to the nike foundation for helping to make the event happen, but also to the 1/2 dozen nike people who helped create many of the aforementioned memories and transformations.</p>

<p>stay tuned for more about this, and what it means to dojo4.</p>

<p>and one, final, thought:</p>

<ul>
  <li>thank you.</li>
</ul>
