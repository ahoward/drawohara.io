</blockquote>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://medium.com/@hornbein">the founder</a> of <a href="https://goodgoodwork.io/">a fellow agency</a> reached out to me about something that seemingly all client services businesses struggle with: how to attract and close on significant contracts. Initially, this seemed like a question about sales and how to make them. But really, it‚Äôs more a question about public relations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚ÄúThere is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.‚Äù</em> - Oscar Wilde</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At dojo4 we‚Äôve relied on word of mouth and referrals for the vast majority of <a href="http://dojo4.com/work">all the clients we‚Äôve ever engaged</a>. Sometimes we go through cycles of doing some sales outreach, but 9 times out of 10, no matter how much effort we put into making sales, the contracts we end up engaging are with people that come through our door because they‚Äôve heard of us from a colleague or because we‚Äôve worked together, in some way or another, in the past. In other words, classic advertising and marketing don‚Äôt seem to make much of a difference for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚ÄúPeople do not buy goods and services. They buy relations, stories and magic.‚Äù</em> -Seth Godin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My suspicion is that it‚Äôs often a constellation of things that end up connecting us with clients. And, somehow it‚Äôs worked because, here we are, still in business and going strong after many years. Here are a few of the factors that I think have been helpful, that I suggested to my fellow founder who had gotten in touch:</p>

  <li><a href="http://ugurus.com/human-relationships-over-revenue-interview-with-corey-kohn-of-dojo4">Speak</a> <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/family-friendly-workplace-manifesto">out</a> about what <a href="https://dev.to/iphreaks/137-ips-program-like-you-give-a-damn-with-ara-t-howard-at-rails-remote-conf-2015">you‚Äôre passionate about</a>, whether or not it directly relates to your work.
    <ul>
      <li>Publicize others that you think are doing cool shit - products, other companies and organizations, individuals - and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=%40dojo4&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en">they will return the favor</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Donate your time, energy and money strategically - do only things you are excited about and prioritize those things that will give you <a href="http://igniteboulder.com/sponsors">visibility</a>, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for.</li>
  <li>Never undersell yourself - it <a href="http://dojo4.com/deck">helps clients understand  your value</a>, even before they start working with you. And always be <a href="https://t.co/oPjjO5sCCX">generous</a>.</li>
  <li>Host community events, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/137778116838365/">parties</a> and conversations that matter (<a href="https://boulderstartupweek2017.sched.com/event/AVHw/b-corp-taco-truck-happy-hour">in-person</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dojo4/policy">online</a>), and don‚Äôt limit these <a href="http://www.awesomeboulder.org/">conversations</a> to what may necessarily be relevant to your particular work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://unreasonable.is/being-yourself-more-important-than-you-think/">Being yourself</a>! Don‚Äôt try to hide your company‚Äôs quirks - people are attracted to confidence and personability; you will lose repeat clients and referrals if those clients were to hire you based on a presentation that ends up being different than who you really are. Genuineness is the most valuable currency.</li>
  <li>Belong! Find <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/community/find-a-b-corp">communities</a> of practice that you want to belong to and have reach within those communities - e.g. since we are a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/community/dojo4">B Corp</a> and a <a href="http://dojo4.com/blog/on-the-lip-of-shared-ownership-dojo4-becomes-a-co-op-series-number-1">cooperative</a>, it feels natural and easy to reach out to <a href="https://foundrygroup.com/blog/2016/05/foundry-group-is-now-b-certified/">other B Corps</a> and cooperatives to let them know what we‚Äôre about and that we‚Äôre available to work with.</li>
</ol>

<p>The bottom line is that you are worth knowing about. Share yourself and your organization with your community and the world around you. Don‚Äôt be shy. Do be <a href="http://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/">creative</a>, bold and genuine, and the right clients will find you.</p>
