  <p><strong>The Power of Passion Projects</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve long been in the habit of asking people ‚Äúwhat are you passionate about?‚Äù verses ‚Äúwhat do you do?‚Äù When you ask this question, in the right circumstances, you‚Äôll get juicy nuggets of wisdom, experience, and things happening behind the scenes. It‚Äôs tough to define a person by his or her job, and more authentic to think about the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Many say I‚Äôm fortunate enough to do work that I love. And while I agree, I don‚Äôt want to downplay that it took a lot of time, commitment and dedication to set my life up this way. Even with a profession that I love, I still have side projects. I‚Äôve nicknamed this ‚ÄúPassion Projects,‚Äù which I deem things that you pour your heart and soul into, things that you spend hours on, and things that you‚Äôre probably not getting paid for (and perhaps you‚Äôre not looking to get paid for). These are projects that you simply just believe in. You usually are trying to fill a need or a void, to solve a problem, to make something better. And that, far outweighs the long nights, or trying to squeeze it in around an already tight schedule.</p>

<p><img src='/ro/dojo4/the-power-of-passion-projects/assets/b.jpeg' alt="dojo4-passionproject.jpg" /></p>

<p>With a passion project, you get to take your skill set beyond the office, and apply it to something where you can see direct impact and results and where you can react in real time. Over time, a passion project could generate some income, get you recognition, and open the door to larger opportunities. But, more often than not, it could take years if it happens at all, and that‚Äôs not why you‚Äôre in the game. If you retrace the steps of some of the unique things happening in your community, or follow some of the spinoffs created by successful business owners, you‚Äôll learn that a lot of these scenarios started as ideas. They started as some wild idea that perhaps no one believed in. They started as the thing that kept someone up at night, or the faint notion that something indeed might be possible, if there was one out there willing to dedicate the time and advocate for it. These are not accidents.</p>

<p>You probably have unique ideas floating around in your mind right now, that perhaps for whatever reason you‚Äôve decided not to explore. Let‚Äôs recap and rethink this:</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS A PASSION PROJECT?</strong>
A passion project is a task, not bound by normal constraints of time and resources, based on an idea that could solve a problem and better something in some way. It‚Äôs the sketches in your notebook, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù factor. It‚Äôs often something only you can see at first, but slowly as you work through the project, others will rally behind you as well. There are no size restrictions, but the standard advice is to think big while starting small. Not all passion projects bring wild success or sustain a legacy, but they are still worth exploring. As an additional note, make sure you‚Äôre in it for the right reasons, as authenticity is highly valued here.</p>

<p><strong>WHY ARE THESE PROJECTS IMPORTANT?</strong>
Because you should be more than the sum of your 9-to-5, or your home life, or your current circumstances and situation. Because you have talents and abilities that can be put to use beyond the classroom or the office. Because this is the free space that we used to have as children, where anything was possible, where we could use what we knew to create, to adjust, and to achieve. Because win or lose, you‚Äôre getting in touch with a different side of yourself, and you‚Äôre affecting those around you by pursuing your project.</p>

<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU START ONE?</strong>
Start small. Think of your skills (this can be as far fetching as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a developer‚Äù or as simple as ‚ÄúI have good organization skills.‚Äù). Think of something that interests you. Look in your community. Ask around. Look beyond your community, perhaps other places around the country or world. Are there opportunities for you to reach out, to get involved, to start a conversation?</p>

<p>Start with a blank page and then fill it in with your thoughts. There‚Äôs something lingering in your mind, something that doesn‚Äôt add up. Write about it. Sketch it out. Is it solvable?</p>

<p>Find others. You are not alone. There‚Äôs actually a tribe of folks (oh yeah, I said <em>tribe</em>) who support various different causes, and applaud people who put in the time or effort to make something better. Passionate people will get excited about what you‚Äôre working on, offer constructive feedback, share life experiences, as well as what they‚Äôre working on too.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an undefined world out there, that doesn‚Äôt fit within most of what is structured, but still has notable qualities that you can apply to all areas of your life. It‚Äôs the world where you feel enabled and empowered to make a shift, and to get things done.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre still stuck on what you can do, join up with another cool project and get your feet wet (search the start-up and volunteer scenes for starters). Eventually, I promise you, the ideas will start flowing. And what happens next, could change your world.</p>
