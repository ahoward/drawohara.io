      // Option 1: Run on initial load AND after Turbo navigations (Recommended)
      // Use 'turbo:load' which fires both after the initial page load and subsequent Turbo visits.
      document.addEventListener('turbo:load', function() {
        // console.log('turbo:load event fired - wrapping YouTube iframes'); // Optional debug log
        wrapYouTubeIframes();
      });

      // Option 2: Explicitly run on initial load (if not using defer/module or for extra safety)
      // If your script might run before Turbo is fully ready or if Turbo might be absent,
      // you might also call it directly or use DOMContentLoaded as a fallback/primary trigger.
      // However, 'turbo:load' *should* cover the initial load too. If you experience issues
      // where initial load isn't handled, uncomment the line below.
      // document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', wrapYouTubeIframes);


      // --- Handling Dynamically Added Iframes (Advanced) ---

      // The above listeners handle iframes present during the 'turbo:load' event.
      // If iframes are added *later* via JavaScript, Turbo Streams, Stimulus actions, etc.,
      // the 'turbo:load' event won't re-fire for those specific additions.
      // For those cases, you have a few options:

      // A) Manually call `wrapYouTubeIframes()` after you know new content containing iframes has been added.

      // B) Use a MutationObserver to automatically detect when *any* nodes are added to the page
      //    and check if they contain iframes that need wrapping. This is more robust but complex.
      /*
      const observerCallback = (mutationsList, observer) => {
        let needsWrap = false;
        for (const mutation of mutationsList) {
          if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
            for (const node of mutation.addedNodes) {
              if (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
                // Check if the added node IS an iframe or CONTAINS iframes
                if (node.matches('iframe[src*="youtube.com"]') || node.querySelector('iframe[src*="youtube.com"]')) {
                  needsWrap = true;

<p>Recently, dojo4 hired two new folks to help the shop take on new challenges. Well, truth be told, we were tired of picking on each other, so we brought on new blood. In any event, if you're in the neighborhood, please stop by and introduce yourself. Meantime, here's some background on these guys.</p>
<p>After 10 years abroad, Brett decided it was time to return stateside. Before doing so, he did tons of research on the perfect place to hang his hat. Boulder fit the bill. We think he made the right choice.</p>
<p>More about Brett:</p>
<dl>
<h2>Why dojo4?</h2>
<p>Since I started working with the dojo4 crew, I felt that I fit in right away and their ideals really aligned with my own.  I haven't been able to wipe this goofy grin off my face since moving out here and working at Dojo4, I love it!</p>
<h2>Where were you before?</h2>
<p>I am a bit of a world traveller.  I was in Sydney, Australia finishing up my Masters and was working there for awhile.  Before that, I was living in Beppu, Japan where I completed my undergrad degree.  I lived in the coolest little hot spring resort town in the world.  After a long day school, I would go for a dip in the hot springs.  For anybody traveling to Japan, I really recommend getting as far away from Tokyo as possible and going to a place like Kyushu or Shikoku, it will be well worth it.</p>
<h2>What are your strong suits or what gets you psyched about working on the Interwebs?</h2>
<p>I am a pretty visually orientated person and really like frontend development where I can see creation as I am coding it.  A lot is going on in the front-end engineering world right now as Javascript is finally earning its wings as a main development language.  Been playing around with Node and Backbone.js recently, it's an interesting time to be doing front-end work.</p>
<h2>What do you do when you're not online?</h2>
<p>I like to rock climb.  Since I've moved out to Boulder, I've been meaning to get into more cycling as well.  Been meaning to do some fly fishing too.  And perhaps some tubing.  Boulder has it all just in my backyard.</p>
<h2>Do you know any martial arts?</h2>
<p>As a matter of fact, I do.  While I was living in Japan, I studied Kendo, the Japanese martial art of sword-fighting.  It taught me discipline and focus in addition to exposing me to a unique part of Japanese culture.</p>
</dl>
<hr>
<p>Hailing from the Granite State, Steve came to dojo4 through the backdoor, which we think Garett left ajar one evening while venturing out for banana ice cream. We're not sure how the paperwork got filled out, but Steve's here, often swaddled in an afgan on the couch or taking a nap (sometimes it's hard to tell the difference).</p>

<h2>Why dojo4?</h2>
<p>Because these folks are way smarter than I. I'm trying to absorb.</p>
<h2>Where were you before?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I'm a failed literary theorist who took to frontend coding, strolling in 120mph winds, and installing remote mountain outhouses. Actually, I'm not really good at the latter, so consider yourself forewarned.</p>
<h2>What are your strong suits or what gets you psyched about working on the Interwebs?</h2>
<p>I have a knack for hoodwinking folks into bike rides. This skill is *highly* undervalued in most workplaces; however, Dojo4 encourages such things. As for nerdy stuff, I like creating grid systems and tarrying with information-dense design. I also enjoy trying to engage audiences with snappy copy.</p>
<h2>What do you do when you're not online?</h2>
<p>My wife and I are fairly active, and yet we're equally adept at indenting couches for great shows like The Wire, Dexter, and Arrested Development.</p>
<h2>Do you know any martial arts?</h2>
<p>Friends have observed that I'm particularly skilled at running and hiding. Is there a name for that discipline?</p>


<p>Welcome to the dojo, fellas!</p>
