  <p>i’ve just spent the last 10 days in and around san francisco for the inaugural girl effect accelerator: the first unreasonable institute program dedicated to helping companies that make a positive impact on the lives of millions adolescent girls do so better and faster through social entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>there are so many totally amazing learnings that came out of this event, and i have a long form post drafted now, but i thought i’d jot down a sneak peak during a flight where i’m as happy to be flying home to my colorado family as i am sad to be leaving my new unreasonable one ;-) === ;-(</p>

<p>get ready to vulcan mind meld; here’s my highlight reel in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>at the airport using the chrome debugger to forge an expired driver’s license at the rental car company…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suddenly realizing that this funny caring guy has built a multi-billion dollar company.  a couple times…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>standing in circle laughing so hard with what is absolutely the funniest group of people ever to stand in such a circle, or possibly to stand period…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>social impact means solving problems that real people actually have and exchanging your solution for a price that is fair to them and you…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being impressed by the deep personal interest that seth godin has in, apparently, every human being he is around…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>companies actually can do better than governments…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wow.  the kitchen staff has more actual entrepreneurial skill than 80% of the tech startups in the world…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>many</em> people just don’t even have fucking light…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>yes, some people really do make deliberate use of their life to make millions of other peoples’ better</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on vineyards there be so much wine…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>girls actually drop out of school because they lack pads.  the sell their bodies to buy pads to stay in school.  this is incredibly fucked up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all problems revolve around understanding people…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>die antwoord videos are best consumed outside on the grass at night with africans and a classical musician…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the bravest people listen to themselves…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people and politics make every company hard…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>girls need voices 10,000 times louder speaking on their behalf…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rahul is a real live sadhu aghori and a hell of a nice guy…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first world and third world problems need new names like ‘waste of your life’ and ‘hair on fucking fire urgent’…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>christen lien is a new type of a super being whose descendants will leave earth to colonize new planets made of pure sound…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is your own startup is actually just making problems…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large groups of empowered women are extremely fun to be around…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you need cash, and have absolutely no clue what the pin on your only credit card is, buy a group of strangers a round and ask ‘em for the dough in exchange</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a hiker i am apparently categorized as ‘very white’…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extremely-well-spoken-lawyer-girl can par-tay!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hope, honesty, and vulnerability can condense a lifetime of friendship into the first 42 seconds of every conversation when the community allows it to happen…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>being massively unprepared for travel is so much fun…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the unreasonable institute runs on blood, sweat, and a new brain wave pattern that repels the need for sleep…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>my back doesn’t hurt anymore…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mobile is absolutely <strong>massive</strong> in the new markets…</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>feet covered with blood blisters from so much walking along the bay…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people who stay to stay the course turn back when they’ve gone off it…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>every person at this camp works at least twice as hard as every other person i know…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7 people and luggage actually do fit in a prius…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>i’d be remiss not to make sincere shout out to the nike foundation for helping to make the event happen, but also to the 1/2 dozen nike people who helped create many of the aforementioned memories and transformations.</p>

<p>stay tuned for more about this, and what it means to dojo4.</p>

<p>and one, final, thought:</p>

<ul>
  <li>thank you.</li>
</ul>
