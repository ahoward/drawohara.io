<p>for some strange reason, this makes me happy</p>

<p><img src='/ro/nerd/index/assets/terminal.jpg' alt="" title="image of terminal" /></p>

<p>as you can read on my <a href="/about">about</a> page, i have written <a href="/rubygems">too much software</a></p>

<p>i got my start researching <em>in</em> <a href="https://www.boulder.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a></p>

<p><em>for</em> <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/">C.I.R.E.S</a></p>

<p>while studying <em>at</em> <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/">CU‚Äôs College of Engineering &amp; Applied Science</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>wut?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>basically, the university has a program that donates young scientists to other
research institutes, to help do science.</p>

<p>its goal is getting the university‚Äôs name on papers which, if you know
anything about science, is gold.  publish or perish‚Ä¶ etc.  publishing ==
funding.</p>

<p><strong>30</strong> years later, i realize that this was a fantastic introduction to start-up
culture.  no b.s., just, make shit that works, and <em>go</em>.  no one to tell you
what <em>‚Äònot to do‚Äô</em> or market signals that design your product for you so you
don‚Äôt have to actually think and be bold - just raw <em>instinct</em> about what
should be studied, how, and <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>that, and fundraising‚Ä¶ ;-)</p>

<p>the first project i did at CIRES, is still one of my favorites: we wrote a
system, designed to run on old-skool linux field computers, that forest fire
fighters would use, tactically, in the field, to decide weather/whether or not
(pun intended), sending a crew up a canyon to battle the blaze would result in
them dying.  mainly it was a wind analysis tool, hyper local weather,
delivered to a device, long before iphones became a thing.</p>

<p>subsequently, i went to work at FSL (Forecast Systems Lab) doing
hyper-high-availability (5 9s ((99.999 % uptime))) for operational satellite
ingest systems.</p>

<p>we designed cutting edge systems and novel‚Ä¶ brutal‚Ä¶ methods of ensuring
consistency of data such as STONITH, which stands for ‚ÄúStone The Other In The
Head‚Äù, in this way we could ensure, unambiguously, that  a single lead system
would have control over each of its subordinate systems.  these days, we take
highly available databases for granted but, at that time, it was a novelty and
the reason that many a c++ or fortran programming perferred the file system
and its almost perfectly uniform hierarchical database format.</p>

<p>i also did a lot of work in model verification.</p>

<p>geophysical models take hundreds, or thousands, or even hundreds of thousands,
of configurations to run.  people talk about how neat 12-factor configuration
is now, and i just shake my head‚Ä¶ what if you had to manage millions of
configuration values?  the next trick is version them, so we know how they
change over time because, as scientists, if we make a change to say, a cloud
physics model, we need to ‚Äòtest it‚Äô.  but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how <em>do</em> you test software, when you don‚Äôt now the ‚Äòright answer‚Äô?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the approach is actually, theoretically, simple:</p>

<p>you hold all variables, all the hundreds of thousands of them, constant, make
changes to a few, and then look for patterns of changes in the output.  in the
case of weather models, this could be mean that a change to a cloud physics
model resulted in predicting 8/9 historical storms with accuracy, vs. the 7/9
a previous iteration would have predicted.</p>

<p>this type of analysis, foreign to many engineers, is back with vengance,
thanks to AI‚Ä¶</p>

<p>my next stint was at <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/">The National Geophysical Data Center</a>, where i was able to participate in a bunch of super cool research:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/purls/can-poverty-rates-be-estimated-using-satellite-data">/purls/can-poverty-rates-be-estimated-using-satellite-data</a></li>
  <li><a href="/purls/a-global-inventory-of-coral-reef-stressors-based-on-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights">/purls/a-global-inventory-of-coral-reef-stressors-based-on-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights</a></li>
  <li><a href="/purls/change-detection-in-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights-1992-2003">/purls/change-detection-in-satellite-observed-nighttime-lights-1992-2003</a></li>
  <li><a href="/purls/a-twelve-year-record-of-national-and-global-gas-flaring-volumes-estimated-using-satellite-data">/purls/a-twelve-year-record-of-national-and-global-gas-flaring-volumes-estimated-using-satellite-data</a></li>
  <li><a href="/purls/global-distribution-and-density-of-constructed-impervious-surfaces">/purls/global-distribution-and-density-of-constructed-impervious-surfaces</a></li>
</ul>

<p>there, we built very, very <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7922">large super-compute</a>,
essentially big fat map-reduce style computing but, at the time, neither of
those terms existed.  we had to invent novel ways, of moving our code of off
big-endian (not spelled wrong) cray (also not spelled wrong) machines and onto
tons of commodity hardware.  namely, hundreds of linux boxen.</p>

<p>i also did a ton of work around clustering‚Ä¶ very low level c/c++ code, using
ideas from signal processing and computer vision, to detect the edges of cities
via a process similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)">watershed algorithm</a>
 but‚Ä¶  at scale.</p>

<p>throughout my tenure at NGDC, i was allowed to release piles of open source
software and, i am very grateful for that.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>coffee break‚Ä¶</strong></p>
<hr />

<p>next, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-greenstreet-082635/">this crazy mofo</a> hired me.  to compile the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU scientific library</a> on.. wait for it‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>windows</strong>!</p>

<p>wowza i am <em>that</em> old!</p>

<p>anyhow, Greg worked for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dospringer/">Don Springer</a>, at company called <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-collective-intellect-060512.html">Collective Intellect</a>.  which, at the time, was the ‚ÄúMobius Group‚Äù (which would eventually become <a href="https://foundry.vc/">The Foundry Group</a> and‚Ä¶ <strong>#BOOM</strong> .. start-ups in Boulder, Colorado, were a thing.</p>

<p>it was fun time.</p>

<p>it was after this that i started <a href="/dojo4">dojo4</a>, which was the crown jewl in my life as a geek, for many reasons i hope to write about soon.  including close to ten years mentoring <a href="https://www.techstars.com/">techstars</a> companies where, i have made some super duper great friends.</p>

<p>until then, i will say, as i always do that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this is a work in progress.</li>
  <li>i am doing it live.</li>
  <li>i cannot spell, so fucking sue me.</li>
</ul>
