<p>well… creating things out of virtual nothingness remains my favorite artform, even after <strong>20</strong> years as a professional software architect. right after <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FwwxEygH55JnQR8n8">traversing natural landscapes and petting dogs</a>, of course.</p>

<p><strong>the journey so far…</strong></p>
<hr />

<p>i got my start back in <strong>1998</strong> as a <em>student assistant</em> at <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/">CIRES</a> and <a href="https://www.boulder.noaa.gov/">FSL (Forecast Systems Lab)</a> at <a href="https://www.boulder.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a>. this is where i learned to do data visualization in <em>R/S/IDL/MATLAB</em> (remember those?), optimize meteorological algorithms in <em>C/Fortran/Lisp</em>, and – here’s the fun part – port the RUC weather model from big-endian Cray machines to little-endian Linux nodes.</p>

<p>oh, and we did all this right across the <strong>Y2K</strong> boundary. no pressure, right?</p>

<p>that’s also where i started contributing to open-source projects, which would become a huge part of my life.</p>

<p>by <strong>2000</strong>, i leveled up to <em>professional research assistant</em> at CIRES’s <a href="https://www.boulder.noaa.gov/">Integrated Systems Group (ISG)</a>. this is where things got real:</p>

<p>we built <strong>24x7 high-availability</strong> platforms for meteorological data ingest and dissemination using <em>ruby, perl, ml, c, c++, bash, java</em> (basically everything). we developed methodology for bi-temporal meta-data support regression analyses over large-scale real-time meteorological models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what does that even mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>basically, we figured out how to test software when you don’t know the ‘right answer’ – you hold all variables constant, change a few, and look for patterns. sound familiar? yeah, it’s back with AI now…</p>

<p>during this time, i released about <strong>~10 open-source libraries</strong> into the ruby, perl, and c ecosystems. just getting warmed up.</p>

<p>from <strong>2003-2007</strong>, i moved over to the <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/">Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)</a> at NOAA, where i studied global population dynamics via <em>nighttime lights</em> – yes, you can track poverty, coral reef stressors, gas flaring, and city growth by analyzing how cities light up at night.</p>

<p>we developed novel user-space super-computing methodologies (before “the cloud” was even a thing), and i worked on edge detection algorithms along high-rate-of-change regions on city boundaries using techniques from computer vision and signal processing like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)">watershed algorithm</a>… but at <em>scale</em>.</p>

<p>we’re talking <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7922">big fat super-compute</a> here – essentially map-reduce style computing before those terms existed. we had to invent novel ways to move code off big-endian Cray machines onto hundreds of commodity Linux boxes.</p>

<p>during this stint, i released <strong>over 100 open-source libraries</strong>. NOAA let me share my work openly, and i’m deeply grateful for that. this eventually led to winning a <strong>Ruby Hero</strong> award.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why do i care so much about open source?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because i believe true innovation comes from creative time to just <em>build things</em>. not from board rooms. not from mining data to give people what they want (which is probably potato chips). but from raw <em>instinct</em> about what should be built, how, and <em>why</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>coffee break…</strong></p>
<hr />

<p>in <strong>2007</strong>, i founded codeforpeople.com, llc. to develop custom solutions for boulder’s emerging start-up space in <em>ruby, c, and java</em>. this was when boulder tech was just starting to explode. i wrote early lines of code for companies that were later acquired by <strong>Oracle</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong>.</p>

<p>then in <strong>2010</strong>, i started <a href="https://dojo4.com">dojo4</a>, which became the crown jewel of my career as a geek. over the next <strong>10 years</strong>, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developed custom solutions for <strong>over 200 tech start-ups</strong></li>
  <li>founded and chaired the <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/boulder">boulder awesome chapter</a></li>
  <li>won that ruby hero award i mentioned</li>
  <li>mentored at <a href="https://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> and Unreasonable Institute</li>
</ul>

<p>it’s been an eye-opening education learning first hand just how much pain tiny and seemingly unimportant technical decisions can cause for future you, how focusing and refocusing on <em>the three most important things</em> over and over is the key to building great software that actually helps people, and witnessing how ruthless commitment to mission and vision can change the world one byte at a time.</p>

<p>in software as in mountaineering, although i appreciate an expedition style, i prefer, and have seen much greater success, with a <strong>fast and light approach</strong>. one that focuses on steel threads, ideals, atoms, ethics, and <em>systems</em> instead of just letting the market define what engineering tasks should be on the board.</p>

<p>in <strong>2020-2021</strong>, i worked as <em>principal engineer</em> at <a href="https://mainstreet.com">mainstreet.com</a>, where i developed a MongoDB-based archive, caching, and analytics layer for external payroll data and introduced key technologies and design patterns into a rapidly evolving code base.</p>

<p>these days (<strong>2021-present</strong>), i’m running a few things:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://matanuskafrontiertrek.com">matanuskafrontiertrek.com</a></strong> – <em>founder, guide</em></p>

<p>a pet project/side business where i developed a Next.js, Strapi, and Render.com-based platform. because why not combine tech and adventure?</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://mountainhigh.codes">mountainhigh.codes</a></strong> – <em>founder, principal engineer</em></p>

<p>developing fast and light engineering solutions for non-profits and mountain companies using <em>11ty, Next.js, and other static-first technologies</em>. bringing simple and cost-effective AI solutions to individuals, non-profits, and small businesses.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://syntheticecho.com">syntheticecho.com</a></strong> – <em>founder, principal engineer</em></p>

<p>services and software that bring the ‘social voice’ to artificial intelligence applications and research.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nickel5.com/">n5</a></strong> – <em>researcher, engineer</em> (2024-present)</p>

<p>currently, i’m working at this boulder-based, private equity backed think tank on some seriously wild problems: training the mind via the visual cortex using EEG analysis (yeah, we’re literally hacking consciousness), and building a ‘perfect oracle’ as a novel DeFi market that models intersubjective reality through market signals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what even is that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>think of it as attempting to create a truth engine that emerges from collective human judgment, tokenized. we’re exploring the boundaries where neuroscience, cryptoeconomics, and philosophy collide. because why not?</p>

<hr />

<p>i am currently in a unique position, having reduced my own life footprint dramatically in order to create space for creativity. it’s because so many big problems still exist, and i would love to talk about yours, and how hard we can go, in order to solve it.</p>

<p><strong>big problems, are big fun.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>where i learned stuff…</strong></p>
<hr />

<p>i started at the <a href="https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/">University of Alaska Anchorage</a> (<strong>1992-1994</strong>) studying biochemistry and competing in D1 nordic skiing. turns out skiing fast and doing science are both pretty rad.</p>

<p>then i moved to the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> (<strong>1999-2003</strong>) where i studied computer science and designed a senior year project for NOAA/CIRES. i earned a <strong>10th place finish at collegiate nationals</strong> and transitioned straight into the workplace at NOAA/CIRES as a research associate.</p>

<p>basically, school and work blurred together in the best possible way.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>this is all, always, a work in progress.</li>
  <li>i am doing it live.</li>
  <li>i cannot spell, so sue me. (a little dyslexic, in fact.)</li>
</ul>
