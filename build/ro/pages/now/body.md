- working with a lil company in boulder doing some crazy AI shit.  frieNDA and a 🍺 for more [deets](https://www.nickel5.com/)...

- building encrypted clipboards that transcend devices. teaching machines when
  to say no. treating tests as scripture and code as sand. specifications as
  prophecy. GitHub as cathedral. message buses for stateless ghosts. keys
  hiding in vaults. everything else burns.

- finally got my leg all bolted back together after 18 mos of injury.  mighty
  lotta PT but, [mountains](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZLLWKpux5jns3JUH9)

- quietly stealthing the new stealth agency which is
  [stealthy](https://mountainhigh.codes).  RN we aren't taking clients, just
  building shit from a bus in Alaska.  like
