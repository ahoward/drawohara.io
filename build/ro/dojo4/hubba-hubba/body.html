<p><a title="http://www.hubboulder.com/" href="http://www.hubboulder.com/">Hub Boulder</a> had its first public event this week out at <a title="http://303vodka.com/" href="http://303vodka.com/">303 Vodka</a>. It was originally slated to be held downtown but when the number of RSVPs climbed to close to 300, we decided to move it out to the <a title="http://assets.flavorwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome_1985-image-497780-1024x687.jpg" href="http://assets.flavorwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome_1985-image-497780-1024x687.jpg">Bartertown</a> neighborhood of Boulder. Despite (or maybe because of) the move, the turnout persisted in being phenomenal and included a whole range of folk, from those who already died-hard members of the Hub to those who came just to find out more. <span><a title="http://www.impactassets.org/about-us/team/timothy-freundlich/" href="http://www.impactassets.org/about-us/team/timothy-freundlich/">Tim Freundlich</a>
