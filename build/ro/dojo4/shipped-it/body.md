[Select New Mexico](http://selectnewmexico.com) is my first Dojo4 project that went live. Select New Mexico is a green chile distributor who wanted a refresh of their web site. It is a great example of the breath of services that Dojo4 provides. Peter designed it, Corey took product photos, Steve built the HTML and CSS and I added transitions and animations to it. 

The result is a beautiful, simple web site that celebrates hatch green chiles and makes hungry for a large bowl of pork green chili.
