One of my younger cousins is moving to the Front Range to attend CSU Fort Collins. Maiele (my cousin) is taking a different approach to funding her education. [She's crowd-sourcing it](https://www.gofundme.com/s54zfk).

Its been 15 years since I was at University, and if it wasn't for [Collective Intellect](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/collectiveintellect/index.html),  I would still be paying off my student loans.
 
Of the folks sitting in Dojo4 today, we have 5 people between 7 and 15 years out of university, 8 degrees, 2 of those degrees (both MS Computer Science) see daily use. Funding sources were: Loans, Parents, Scholarships and Canada. 1 person is still paying on their student loans. 

I find it encouraging that [Maiele](https://www.gofundme.com/s54zfk) is using [her skills](http://maiart.weebly.com/) and finding creative ways to fund her education.
