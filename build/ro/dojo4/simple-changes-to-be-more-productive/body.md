How does one stay productive in such a busy world? A world where people wake up and check their Facebook statuses as soon as their alarm goes off. "Must let folks know I'm awake-----". Or in a world where you wear several different hats (parent, sibling, friend, employee, business owner, feeder of dog, etc). It can get confusing and also overwhelming. Do you ever feel like there's not enough time in the day or like you just can't get anything done? Here are some simple tips to help you de-clutter the outside world, so you can streamline and be more productive at what you do best.

But first, let me update my Facebook status....... just kidding.

REDUCE YOUR CLUTTER: How can you think in a crowded space? You can’t! There’s no space for energy to flow in and out of your life. And so it gets caught, in between stacks of papers or piles of who knows what or things you plan on going through later. That time is now. Sound like too daunting of a task for you? Break it up into sections and work on small parts towards a larger goal. Schedule time to do this weekly/daily like you would schedule lunch with a friend or soccer practice for the kids. Clearing your space and getting rid of the old makes so much room for the new and it will feel amazing.

OPEN YOUR WINDOWS: Windows are on your house or apartment for a reason! Open them and let some of that natural light and fresh air in. So many spaces are stagnant because nothing is flowing through them. We, as human beings, need sunlight, we need fresh air, we need to feel the world around us. Feel the sun on your face, the wind in your hair, go outside, or if weather doesn’t permit look out the window and take note of what’s around you. If your scenery does not permit, go find a park or somewhere that does and sit there for a while. Being in natural surroundings helps you think clearer.

START THE DAY WITH A GOOD THOUGHT: Whether it be a positive mantra, a picture of your family, or a statement about what you want to accomplish, you should live every day with purpose. And a positive mantra can be as simple as “today is my day!” or “today is an amazing day,” or “I attract all the right people in my life today.” It can be whatever you want, but it should be positive and it should be something you can take ownership of. Do this and don’t sweat the small stuff. Suddenly you will rise above daily nuances and things that used to throw you off track, and you will align yourself with a deeper goal and meaning of purpose.

TURN OFF THE NOISE: Checking social media and email have become the nervous tics that move our society in a strange direction I'm not always sure is forward. We want to know whats going on all the time. We see an email come in and we have to read it. We just finished lunch and we need to go online to find out what everyone else ate. Social media, while effective when used in the right way, is also a huge time hog and can kill your productivity. The same goes for sporatic email checking. Set times to check your email and social media that work with your schedule so its a welcomed break and not a hinderance to your work. Email can be checked at (for example) 10am, 12noon, and 3pm. Social media can be checked at 12noon and at the end of the day. If you run social media campaigns for work, utilize an app that can schedule your posts, so you don't have to check in all the time.

Now go forth and be productive!
