<p>dojo4 recently had the opportunity to work closely with <a href="http://gnip.com/" title="http://gnip.com/" target="_blank">GNIP</a> to produce the <a href="http://bigboulderconf.com/" title="http://bigboulderconf.com/" target="_blank">BigBoulderConf</a> branding, website and all conference collateral (badges, lanyards, brochures, signage, welcome cards, carabiners, water bottles, sunscreen, hangtags and chapstick) . The goal of the brand was to combine Boulder's mountain aesthetic with the professionalism of the content of the conference, "the future of publicly-available <a href="http://gnip.com/" title="http://gnip.com/" target="_blank">social data</a>." We used the iconic image of the Flatirons and simplified it into a triangular shaped mountain so that it would be recognizable by anyone. If you notice, the mountain logo contains the 3 main shapes that make up the first, second and third flatirons.</p>
<p>BigBoulderConf is in session today, June 21 and tomorrow June 22. <br />Check it out!</p>
