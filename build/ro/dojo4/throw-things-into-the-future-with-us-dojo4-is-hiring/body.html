<p>dojo4 co-creates incredible technology products with great customers.  We've helped launch many of Boulder's thriving startups: Blipsnips, Everlater, Graphic.ly, RoundPegg, Snugg Home, lokalite, Splickit and many more.</p>
<p>We are growing our team of excellent professionals. We're hiring more people like us: cloud-deploying API-building HTTP experts; DOM-manipulating mobile-first JQuery-slinging front-end experts; and generalists who rock.</p>

<p>We build stuff.<br />Our culture is built on the premise that engineers thrive when they have challenging work, smart colleagues, good benefits, their choice of tools, a dojo4 hoodie, and respect. We'll treat you right.</p>
<p>You should have code in the public domain that we can read. You should like hacking on wicked projects. You should be able to own a sale, a project, a process, a server, a meeting, a relationship, an API, a bike. You should come by the shop and pair with us sometime! Email: hire_me@dojo4.com</p>
