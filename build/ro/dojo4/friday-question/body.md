Here's the context... It's Friday at noon. We stand in a circle. We [bow](https://media.giphy.com/media/MUeQeEQaDCjE4/giphy.gif). We [clap](http://clap.resn.co.nz/). We do a minute of [silent meditation](http://sitillustrated.com/images/snore-top-meditator-meditation-cartoon.gif). One person asks a question that helps us know and understand each other better. We've had easy questions and hard questions, poignant questions and silly questions. We use the guidelines of [council](http://www.centerforcouncil.org/what-is-council.html) as the framework to answer the question:

* speak from the heart
* listen completely
* be spontaneous
* be lean
* everything is confidential

And we signal the end with a clap and a bow and then we all have lunch together.

We do it every week, whether there are 2 of us or 12 of us. We do it with guests. We do it whether we're busy or not. It's part of how we've overcome the inevitable seasickness that comes with the swells and dips of being a small business. No doubt, it's made us a better business.
