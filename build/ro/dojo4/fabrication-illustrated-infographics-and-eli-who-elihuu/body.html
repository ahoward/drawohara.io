<p>dojo4 had the opportunity of to work with Dorian Ferlauto, founder of <a href="http://elihuu.com" title="http://elihuu.com" target="_blank">Elihuu.com</a>. Dorian is a veteran of the design industry and was recently the buyer at <a href="http://factorymadeboulder.com/" title="http://factorymadeboulder.com/" target="_blank">Factory Made</a> before setting off on the creation of her own start-up business. Elihuu connects designers and manufacturers in the swiftly burgeoning maker movement.  dojo4 developed a brand identity and created a marketing strategy that will help potential investors and clients visualize the complex world of custom fabrication.</p>
<p>After workshopping a few options with the client, we felt an infographic-based illustration set would be a flexible asset. This way she would have the option of combining the various pieces into cohesive visual presentations without having to invest additional monies for studio time. I think infographics are generally overused in the design marketplace, but this seemed like a great opportunity to illustrate an idea. The formula was simple and we executed a simple <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/" title="http://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> website, brand identity, and visual assets in 2 weeks of work.</p>
<p>It was fun to execute in an agile fashion and get the assets designed, a small website deployed and the information out on the street. Dorian is out spreading the news about her product and we are hopeful it really takes off, its a great idea!
