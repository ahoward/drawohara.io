Mathematician and artist used to be pretty much the same job (see above drawing by [Rafael Araujo](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1854671654/golden-ratio-coloring-book)).

You know who you are.  You're still teetering on the verge of [filing that extension](https://brasstaxes.com/extension), even though Tax Day is less than a week away.

Enter Rus Garofalo of [Brass Taxes](https://brasstaxes.com/). He specializes in taxes for the self-employed, especially us artist-types.  DOJO4 had the opportunity to re-build the backend of [http://brasstaxes.com](https://brasstaxes.com/) this year, so we can honestly say: it works beautifully!

Listen dear friends: having someone else file your taxes - someone who actually understands the IRS' ever-changing rules - *is* your god-given right as an adult. Can't afford it?  Planning to DIY with Turbo Tax?  Aside from being a tax write-off, Brass Taxes will be more fun and less expensive than Turbo Tax, as [Rus explains in this video](https://youtu.be/9fEm9Y0cpOI) (while wearing a diaper).
