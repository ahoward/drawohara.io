This message recently went out to our crew.  How do you manage distraction?


--------------------------------------------


working in the digital realm is an awesomely overpowering source of distraction that drives us to consume without creating.  some ideas for fighting back

* shut off email

* answer emails once, or twice, per day

* shut of twitter, assbook, and other social networks

* shut of propane.  we'll find you iff we need to

* do one thing at a time.  multi-tasking is distraction itself.

* block out time.  this in the morning.  that in the afternoon.

* finish something.  stopping at 90% costs time, money, and creates and open loop in your mind

* focus on methods that let you create without consuming: you can post a picture without logging into twitter/facebook/tumblr by just sharing an image via email to your account.  you can create posts, gists, or other content using scripts or tools that let you do so without reading/consuming other cones.  you can 'git commit' even when the internet is completely off.

* build you own.  sure you can find it on google - along with a 45 minute diversion into the abyss

* IM is the devil

* adjust your phone so that, if it rings, you know you have to pick it up

* spend time and aggressively filter you inbox with gmail.  if it makes it into your inbox is should be important by default.  everything else should be filters or deleted automatically.

--------------------------------------------------



* when you notice that you are distracted, go for a walk around the block 
* talking in person (especially when the other person is in the same room) is likely a more effective, quicker and less convoluted option than email 
* don't always trust the impulse to answer all emails / txts immediately - a little space, even a few minutes, will probably make the communication more effective
