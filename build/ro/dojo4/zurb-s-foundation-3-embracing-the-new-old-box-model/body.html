</figure>
<p>Last week, the clever folks at ZURB rolled out version 3.0 of their <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> CSS framework, a competitor to Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>What struck me right away about ZURB's latest release is that it globally resets the W3C box model, a strategy <a href="http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/" target="_blank">Paul Irish proposed in a recent blog post</a>. This means Foundation 3 offers <strong>no support for IE7</strong>.</p>
<p>Bootstrap also reverts to the traditional box model for its <code class="lightestgrayBg">row-fluid</code> layouts, adjusting widths and margins using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter#Star_hack" target="_blank">star hack</a> to allow for IE7 support. But its fixed layouts still use the W3C model.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm a big fan of the box model reset strategy, and I know our backend team would be thrilled&mdash;when they drop content into views, they use tables just to avoid all the arcana surrounding the W3C model. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug#Background" target="_blank">traditional box model</a> just makes sense.</p>
<p>Moreover, I'm excited by the prospect of developers&mdash;specifically, those who contribute to CSS frameworks&mdash;having a hand in shaping the supported browser landscape. As nice as it's been to have <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/06/our-plans-to-support-modern-browsers.html" target="_blank">major tech companies</a> take an interest in this landscape, it's even better for us to take ownership of it.</p>
